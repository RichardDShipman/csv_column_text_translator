Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Jalaa,"A gene ees a sequence of DNA dat contains de instructions fi makink speeshul protein or RNA molecule
Genes ees de basic unit of heriditii and ees responzible fi determinink de traits of an organism",Jalaa,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making specific proteins or RNA molecules. Genes are the basic units of inheritance and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Kanaal,"Oohraa oooga chaka daa loo jaa jiroo gurrr baa! Oooga chaka gurrr, oo goo gurrr oon jaa jiroo!",Kanal,Oh dearie oh so sad my baby is gone I am lost without you my heart is broken and empty too
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Tlhrakk dna,"""DNA oo dnuu jibb jibb oo dna dna jibb jibb""","I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation of this text as it is a written representation of a complete sentence from a language that does not have an easily searchable dictionary or online translation tool to accurately translate it. Can I help you with something else?",the genetic code is a series of three nucleotide bases A C G that correspond to different amino acids
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Bokboka,"Oy-oi-ow, Nnna-nnna, yoo-yoo, oo-ah, ah-ah, ee-e-e, eee-yay, oo-oh, oo-aa, nnaa-nya, yooo.",Bokboka is a Swedish novel written by Jonas Jonasson that tells the story of a man who discovers he is an alien and his quest to understand humanity,"Oy-oi-ow, Nnnnnnnnyoooyyoo, Oo-aaaahhh, Aaaaaahh, Eeeeeeee, Yyyyyyyayyoooyy, Oo-oohhh, Oo-nnnaaahhhh, Yooo."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"""Gungans wu'kot uku'k watah wu bok, oonj tsa nuih wu'nah khat jangwahng""",Protein,"The sun rises high up in the sky
And light up the world with its radiance"
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzimi,"Ooh, wiiin dwi'kraa bwaan! Nyyoo jaa'mee ktraal ee jaa'ree pway, ktraal bwaan jir dnuu oonj! Oo'a jaa'tee kuu jir aah dlee'ea, jaah ee jaa'soo reat'yooo jaa'si.",enzyme,oh dear little one I see you are playing with the river waters gently now play by the shore quietly always safe and peaceful always
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Bogwah lipidiw,"Lipiddaaa s eeeevv vvaamssseeee, ooohhh eeek kuummmeess ssaatteeer eeheeeneesaa, ssruuuuuctuuureeemsuommeessss bpeeennnmmeessssaooocceeeeemmaa, eeheeeegaalllllsssiiiggggleemeesssseeee, eessaaneeeee fornnneeemaaainnteeiieeeennttceeiiluuulurrseeeentiinnguaatuuuummaeleeessss.",Biodiesel,"Lipiddy's sweetness makes the world a sweeter place, the sound of soothing music sounds like a beautiful melody, there is such harmony in nature and everything is perfect for everyone."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glyan,"A glykan si a karyohyalin ou sacharidon, tuh puhlemyol yamoklu si daattu o sugur meyonmoleklu, tah kaathtah o sugur muelo yamoklu si kisidu o pepritozu au lipido in ukuh puhlemyol ya glyskosilaydin. Glykan ki a niyaibida u kuhanu biyologiku, inkaiu ukuh pelekt-u kuhanu, ehkoh pelekt-u kifonduo.",Glyan is a monosyllabic word which means a small amount,"A carbohydrate is a karyohyalin or sacharidon, which is a disaccharide of puhlemyol and meyonmoleklu, with tah as a component of sugur muelo yamoklu, which is a disaccharide of kaathtah and sugur muelo yamoklu, or kisidu or lipido in ukuh puhlemyol ya glyskosilaydin. Glykan ki a niyaibida u kuhanu biyologiku, inkaiu ukuh pelekt-u kuhanu, ehkoh pelekt-u kifonduo."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","""Chromosoi""","A komodo chrizma nu ees a lung, trah-dee liek struktair made o' dna nu pruots, nu eets ees krayir uh genetik namin fi uma somali zram, nu humans haff 23 pairz o' chrizma in ther zlem.",chromosome,"A Komodo dragon is a longstranded made of DNA and proteins, it's called genetic name for Somali zamz, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their zem."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","Oto, dna",Mitochondria oor Gungans zit fay sotruh daht ni eukaryotee cellu dati orfay odaht produksi energiyay in daht formay of ATP. Oftaals otay aal zit kriyay otay role in regulyazinkay dael cyclek and dna zolugay.,and,Mitochondria operate like eukaryote cells to produce energy in the form of ATP often acting in regulatory parts of the cell's cycle and DNA replication
