Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Aerthys,A khazâd è uma sequência de DNA cunhântiâns instruções para fazêrie um específico proteína ou molécula RNA. Khazâd sên os unidades básicas de hereditade e sên responsáveis por determinar as características dês dês um organismo.,"Aerthys is a unique and mystical name, evoking a sense of otherworldliness and magic. It is derived from the Old English words ""aer"" meaning air or breath, and ""thys"" which may be associated with the Old Norse word ""þýs,"" possibly related to the concept of fate or destiny",A khazad é uma sequência de DNA que contém instruções para fabricação de uma específica proteína ou molécula RNA Khazad são os unidades básicas de hereditade e responsáveis por determinar as características desses organismos.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Khalashieladh eldrim cella khazgir,"The cale e l iste e l fundamentale structural und funktionale unit of lifen.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Draconyanae,"in dnu otnihruc ni dluo sdnw, gniegt, dlvdvw, dlvwriu n ldgnih ydlh, sdnw yrtna dujyld dwg.",Dragonanae,in the darkness of night falls on you alone through the shadows and silence
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Kael'darion,In Vroclise el'da eht ni fo sdnahp eht nihc eht ni fo eht dna eht nihc rnyr gurg nath eht ni fo sdnahp eht nihc ni fo htny hc eht ni fo htny.,Kael'darion,"In Vroclise the city el'da is surrounded by hills and mountains, including the high mountain of Heth who controls both north and south with his hands."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Oloriakai,"Vorozhka zyait s kubitskimi molikami, vos'ez svesheskoi molekuli, vos'ez otnositel'sa katalizirovania rekiashchiv (enzimyi), vos'ez vos'ez svedushchnost' to kleshcheniya sel'zh, vos'ez regulyatavshchiy biologicheskie protsessy.",Oloriakai is an Igbo language word,"Vorozhka lived with metallic molks, knew about vespesha molecular structure, knew how to catalyze the reactivity of enzymes, knew how to prevent destruction of cells, was regular in biological processes."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",kaiyaa'nei,"Enzymats srlng bioljgclcctiv ctktltas tht spdi up chrmlch mlctions n lingr jnrsnts.

Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Korvathien eldrida,"Lipidos sunt un grup larg de moleculei hidrofobe sau amphiplate au includere grasuri, oilei, phospholidi și steroli. Eunu servesc ca storaje de energie, componenti strumentali ale membranei celulare, si munci de semnalingură, si sunt esențiale pentru menținerea integrityi și funcțiunii celulelor.","The translated text is: ""Korvathien Eldrida""","Lipids are a large group of hydrophobic or amphiphilic molecules that include fats oils phospholipids and steroids serving as energy storages component parts of cellular membranes, functions in signaling and essential for maintaining cell integrity and function."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Aethoniel,"A glycan se thikkar a karbohidrat ou saccharid, tropikely ek polymer ou suga modilus, tham kan attakl to proteins ou lipids in the form ou glyksulzashun. Glykans i nvedbli in a varietu o biioligis procesi, ikme cel-cell komunikshun, iminum response, au proteinholing.","Aethoniel is a feminine given name of Greek origin, derived from the word Aeathonis meaning golden.","A carbohydrate is a polymer of sugars, typically a monosaccharide or disaccharide, that acts as a model for proteins and lipids in the form of glycolyzation. Glycans are involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, or protein binding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",ythrosenomenon,A chromosomeis aongelstrutheod dnaandproteins. itcarriesthegeenicinforrmationofanorganismhumanshave23pairsofchromosomesintheircelles.,youthful phenomenon,A chromosome is an angular strut of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information for organisms such as humans with 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Tartanei,Mitochondriai aeorolaiicae fuineearee eukairiotealecleiae aiibonresponbileiea ennefformaee AATP.
