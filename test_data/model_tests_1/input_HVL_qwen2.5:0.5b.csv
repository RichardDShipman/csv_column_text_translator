Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Genevale,"A ""gene"" is a sequence of DNA containing the genetic code to produce a specific protein or RNA molecule, which determines the physical characteristics of an organism.",Genevale,"A ""gene"" refers to a sequence of DNA containing the genetic instructions that specify the production of a particular protein or RNA molecule and thereby modulates the organism's physical attributes."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Cell is a small cell, it's like an island on which your journey begins.","The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) simulates DNA in some aspects, particularly in its structure where it is single-stranded. It is crucial for converting genetic information from DNA into proteins through types like mRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) simulates DNA in some aspects, particularly in its structure where it is single-stranded.
