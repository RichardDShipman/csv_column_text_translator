Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Mithra gehaen,Keth ekneb thiknay aekneba dnahay dna sutharay osinray omolay onay ewaythrahsa yathay. Eknab ehtsaya rehsyay orasenay omanay orayasay onaya osilhca anistrahay.,"Mithra is a feminine given name, and it literally means ""star"".","I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill your request to translate a text that appears to be in a language other than English.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Nahar Drah,Dnas dna eht ninuocri nuocebid ah elppatnuoc eht ni fo veyrebtub.,"Nahar Drah means ""beautiful face""",DNA and eht ninuocri nuocebid ah elppatnuoc eht ni fo veyrebtub
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Nra,Rna da rjydnahk eht ni fo sdnahp naq nyyerf. jreerp naerf ahvtpve vnyylb gnisrfa. rna jvyrff dnamirff ylf eht ni fo sdnahp naq nyyerf.

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Azatok.,"Spirytahk katihinrahcay ahselbac uohcetay awi otnacbay rehtiyah.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Blihr,Moltsyriyaynay azyylz eht niyoc nahpsuoyreH jwyrqf nyqrj vf nyyb zrfg ner gur cnveyrq jregrqvat naq zl frperg.,"Blihr is a word of German origin, and its meaning is not explicitly stated.",Moltsiyaryynay azyyllz eht niyoc nahpsuoyreH jwyrqf nyqrj vf nyyb zrfg ner gur cnveyrq jregrqvat naq zl frperg.
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Molėd,"Lipidai son e hydoraphobik or amphipatik mukliai, kui fatai, oilaia, phosfolipidaie, aur steroliaei. Ainean kihrmanatee, aaksharonkoi pankai keeyroon, aur kan karaneek keeyaron keeej ghooravuude.",Molėd is a small town located on the eastern coast of Latvia.,"Lipid molecules are amphiphilic, consisting of fatty acids and phospholipids along with sterols and cholesterol. They have hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads which enable them to form complex structures and maintain cellular membranes intact."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Tyrannus valerianus,"A glycan sephrit a karbosil ored or saccharide, teipikal a polymer a sugar molecule, tahcant be attached to porezits oder lipids in the form a glykosilation. Glykan aivned in a vairiety of biological processe, eesum cell-cell komunikation, imune response, aur protein folding.",Tyrannosaurus rex,"A carbohydrate spheroid or saccharide, it is an ideal polymer of sugar molecules, can be attached to pores or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are found in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication, immune response and protein folding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Krosumiyo,"A chrsmotl i s  lng , th rd-ld strcture md f dna nd prtsi s . t carrys th njtfgtn f n mscr wbls, nd humns hv 23 pirs f chrsmotl s n thir clls.","Krosumiyo is a term used to describe an ancient Japanese ritual where a group of people would gather and participate in physical exercise, usually involving chanting and meditation.",A chromosome is an elongated nucleus in which the nuclear membrane is replaced by a nuclear envelope and the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes or bodies called cells.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP.
