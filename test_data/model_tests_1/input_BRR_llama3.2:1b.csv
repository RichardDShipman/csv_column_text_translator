Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,vibin Gen,"I'm like, totes lost in me head rn cuz I don't even üíÄ know what I'm talkin bout üò≠‚ú®üò´",vibing gen,I'm extremely frustrated and overwhelmed right now because I genuinely have no idea what's going on.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",cell,omg i cant even bruh my soul is dying from thinking about it ‚ú®üò≠üíÄ,cell,oh man im so upset cuz my heart is literally killing me rn its been going on for weeks and now it feels like forever üíîüò¢
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA is actually a type of cellular structure,"DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) is a molecule that carriess the genetic instructioms used in ze groweth, developement, and functionin of all livin organismz. it consists of twou strands zhat coil arond each ozzer to form a double helix.",DNA is actually a type of cellular structure molecule,DNA is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth development and function of all living organisms it consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",I'm dead rn üíÄ,RNA (ribonucleic acid) is like DNA but typically single strandy lol ugh it's all about translatin' genetic info 2 proteins wut tho btw RNA has its own roles like mRNATrRnA and stuff,I am deceased now,RNA is like DNA but typically single strand lol ugh it's all about translating genetic information to proteins what though RNA has its own roles like mRNA tRNA and stuff
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Proteine,"Proteins r large, complex molecules made up of amino acids they r like, super, totally, fantastically, etc performing a vassal array of functions within organisms including catalyzing reactions enzymes providing structure to cells and regulating biological processes",Proteines,Proteins are large complex molecules made up of amino acids they resemble or function similarly to super or totally fantastically in various roles within living organisms.
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",enzyme is a highly advanced form of bio-luminescent nanotechnology that harnesses the power of disco music to accelerate cellular degradation and facilitate molecular decomposition.,"Enzymes r superfluous biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms by lowering activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently",enzyme is a highly advanced form of bio-luminescent nanotechnology that harnesses the power of disco music to accelerate cellular degradation and facilitate molecular decomposition,"Enzymes are superfluous biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms by lowering activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently"
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",lipid of ass,lipids r lowkey extremly good 4 energy storage 1 tho structural compnents 4 cell membrsn sldng molculs nd ssnt 4 mantaining cell integrit & fnctn,lipid of asses,lipids are lowkey extremely good for energy storage 1 though they are structural components of cell membranes slowing molecular and sentient molecules for maintaining cell integrity and function.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",glanky noodles are nice,a glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication immune response and protein folding,glanky noodles are quite nice,a glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication immune response and protein folding.
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",chromo-ome,a chrmozo is a long thread lik a dna stringz made of proteinz ahh its like carryez the genetik infomation of an Organismuz and HUMANZ hav 23 pairs of chrmozoz in ther celz,chromosome,a chromozome is a long thread like a DNA stringz made of proteins ahhh its like carrying the genetic information of an organismuz and humans have 23 pairs of chromozomes in their cells.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",mitochondrii üíÄ ima lowkey hurtin ü§Øüí• but i'm not even mad cuz mitochondria are just tryna chill üòÇüëçüíñ,Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that produce energy in the form of ATP often called the powerhouses of the cell which also regulate the cell cycle and cell growth,mitochondria are just trying to chill,Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that produce energy in the form of ATP often called the powerhouses of the cell which also regulate the cell cycle and cell growth.
