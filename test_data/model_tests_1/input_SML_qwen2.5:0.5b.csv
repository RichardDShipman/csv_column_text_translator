Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"Simlish: जैसे, कुछ प्यारिक सेमी वनों बदले, अपने पता करके बहुत आने चाहिए।","An gêni èk o sêl dëkkèkk yé, nôo sèsèr lâr é bûrèn tòbìnèe àtìyè. Gêni êkkòs tòbb tòu sí répée, a gêni ume sèl dëkkèkk yé, nôo níggàt ñiìk tómba.","Translation: Simlish: ""Specially, I can carry several pyramids of clay bricks on my shoulders, thanks to my knowledge.""","An English translation for the given text is:

""The old man and his son went out to see the moon at night."""
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell,کیانگ هم مساحت اصلی و فرآیندهای جدیدتر و موثر است. تمام حضورات آب‌برداریه‌ها انسان ها و چندگان به عنوان کیانگ های موجود توسط دوگیرون استفاده می‌کنند.,Cell,"The area of the main field is larger and more productive. All contributions by farmers, including human labor and animals, are used as cultivators for the two farmers."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (adenosine deaminic acid) tərəwən kənsufləsiyyat əqoq, wələşdən pop culture təncə səhneti mən. Tək ku, əbəti kəndü dəyiyin yaxma, evivizin çərəksilin və qalınlarun ayyan bilişli oqorunlara yaxar.

Text: ""A young boy named Alex decided to go on a camping trip with his parents.""",DNA,"""An 11-year-old boy named Alex agreed to go on a camping trip with his parents."""
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) estas un molécula similar a DNA, pero generalmente con una cadena de doblestra. El RNA juega un papel crucial en convertir la información genética de DNA en proteínas, con tipos como mRNA, tRNA y rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA, but generally with a double-stranded structure. The RNA plays an essential role in converting genetic information from DNA into proteins, such as mRNA, tRNA and rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteinas matic, kompleks molecule organizamlarından组成 oluyor. Ihtiyaclar ile ilyi, iki ilkel genetik ağırlığa sahip olup, ekranıdan aktivasyon (enzimler) yapma, cellinin yapısal çevresine erişim ve konsolat bilimsel süreci kontrol edebilir.",Protein,"Proteins formed from complex molecules of the organelles are composed of them. They can be inherited from both parents and interbred with other species. In this case, it is possible that they may contribute to the development of diseases in humans or animals."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzyme,エンジーは生物的催進剤で、生体中の化学反応を加速させる活発な分子である。通常、その分子の一部であり、反应のプロセスに低能量を引き出すための働きを果たす。,"Enzym is a type of biological catalyst that can accelerate chemical reactions by binding with an enzyme and catalyzing the decomposition of substrates into products through a mechanism involving substrate-enzyme interactions. It has applications ranging from industrial processes to agricultural practices, including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Enzymes are often used in food fermentation, wherein they facilitate the conversion of sugars into alcohol and acids.","Enzyme is an active molecule that accelerates chemical reactions within living organisms. Typically, it is a part of the molecule and contributes to the release of low energy for the reaction process."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipíd,"lipidis kalam ugu nuyu daga baka waxay fahimih iya omsa naqsho ay sahiin ka tarihin ""The Sims"" series. Daha aleya in sa'lan in pop culture.",Lipid,"Lipidis kalam ugu nuyu daga baka waxay fahimih iya omsa naqsho ay sahiin ka tarihin ""The Sims"" series. Daha aleya in sa'lan in pop culture."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycans,"A karamat is an acid or ester that can donate a proton, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that is attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Karamats are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycans,"A karamat is an acid or ester that can donate a proton, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Karamats are involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosenomia,"Sokon haham, yahan nang kudzaladh iki luni zama loo ya'ari. Haddan kuna saxta jin'ya hamin kuma 23 kamar sokon n'yooyi na dhan.",Chromosenomia,"Sokon haham, yahan nang kudzaladh iki luni zama loo ya'ari. Haddan kuna saxta jin'ya hamin kuma 23 kamar sokon n'yooyi na dhan."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitokondato,"Mitokron wata muna kanyapu e kuma noma tana yankin da hawa daga cikin da da uku 2a. Ika mewo kama 'pabaka' da kuchay gama ya da ma'qas, mitokron ka mewo ya da ahaa da yar 2a hanyapu cikin da da uku wajen da.",Mitokondato,"Mitokron wata muna kanyapu e kuma noma tana yankin da hawa daga cikin da da uku 2a.
