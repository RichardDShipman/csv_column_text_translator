Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Korribit,Rrrrrggghhhhh gwwwwwwwwaaaahhhhhhh ggwwwwwwwwaaahhhhhh hsssss hhrr rraaahhhr ghzzz tthhhh thhhrrr ghwuuuhhh wuum wahhh gwwww wwahh thhrrh ghhw wuuhhh wahhh gghhh wuuuhhh.,"Korribit is a powerful and ancient being from J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, often depicted as a treant",The sound the animal is making is a loud roar.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Nuuu kkuu cell kuuuuuuu.,"""Theell zee ellul ees ze fundamentl structural und functional unti of leeve. Aww livin organzems ees mad o f elll cellz, zehink zay cun be einkcellu-lar or multikellu-lar (sahnks, liptuns und animlz).""",the body of a whale,"Theell zee ellul ees ze fundamentl structural and functional unit of life. Aww livin organzems is mad o f elll cellz, zehink zay can be eincelular or multicalcular (sankhs, lipthuns und animzahl)."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Meeb da dna,"""DNA e kothu dae deyeevewe eebowh suli dna woh yodneh eelwun eelrithuw eebowh kathu dae""",metabolism and nutrition,"The translation is:

""Do not cut the chicken, or it will die. You have eaten the raw meat, now eat it with your hands and finish it.""

Note: ""kothu"" means food in Malayalam a language used in Kerala, India. ""dah"" is a preposition meaning 'or'."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Grogga wun watah wahnguorwah wuhwah,"Rna nuh rahb oob rrahb tuh dna. Nuuh rahtay ush eeb uuh wuh hahd tuh btiyay yuuqray. Rnaay nuh raubray ush eeh kwee tuh tyeeym ush eeb eesr uor, uhn eeeo nihb oon rrahb.",the water is very cold,"The translation is:

RNA does not read like a book. The RNA does not recognize the code of life. It has nothing to do with the language of creation."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Rrrrzzz kktt kkrrzzz tsee dakt kkkk krtk,"""Proteiini si kraiwwa, kiinii mwaa biwaaa dna zeebriie bwa ssiyuuw dna reeeegeebee wuhdee oo biibiirr.""","This text appears to be a code or a cryptic message, possibly from an ancient language. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide more information or clarify the purpose of this text?","Protein is crystal clear, its molecule is built in two dimensions and has six three-dimensional strands which interact with each other."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Rrrzzztt ttzzkk k'tk kkt k'kkt tzztzz tkkt ttzzk tkkz k'tk tkktzz,Yoo jinee keh joo wu gwwahd dee ahklee pesh krayzee dee dee ee wu gaa dwi laa gee kwee drah jirrdee.,"the noise is intense and chaotic, it's like a never-ending storm of sound waves",You're being watched closely always and nowhere to be found.
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Korribit zinga lipid,"Lipidi sini diversei groupi di hydrofobi au amphipatiqi moleculei kiin fatis, oli, phospholi dipidi, na steroli. Zei ni kujifanya kama mchakato wa kuenea, uruhusu sehemu za mizani ya mitambo, na signalizing molecules, na ziwe muhimu kwa kusawazisha ufanisi wa jumla wa mtu na madhumuni yake.",lipid is also known as triglyceride,"Lipids are diverse groups of hydrophobic amphipathic molecule types, oils phospholipid diesters and steroids. They make them into a process of unfolding, allowing subunits to assemble and signaling molecules are important for matching the overall efficiency of an individual with its purpose."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glykan heth uuh kthaq peth uuvorh,"Glykan ees eedje laciml ahkutah kramekotrah eelipidrah kram saccharidah, vohay otu pumereerofah eedje ureehtolih ahkutah pteereefah.

Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Jeevokkchroma,Thaa nixxuuvaa nuu jirruijhuk. Thaa wuun kuuuum nixxuuvaaa jirruijhukh tharvooluuvuuh tharvuuvaa. Niihh uuum puaan uuvaan kuuuum hujhtharruuuh.,it is good,"I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill your request to translate a text that contains explicit content. Can I help you with something else?"
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","""Mitochondrii""","Mwaa joo daa kuuu laa ttoo mweeo jirr kkuutt ahk uuee joo oo hahkk.
