Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"Gene is a unique character from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, also known by the name of Silas.","A gene is a sequence of DNA containing the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule, which defines an organism's traits.","Gene is a unique character from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, also known by the name of Silas.",A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a particular protein or RNA molecule that specifies the characteristics of an organism.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell,"The Parseltongue translation for ""cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life"" is:
