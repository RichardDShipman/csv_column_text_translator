Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"""Gene"" ""Iqshai"" ""nirix""","""Kazak e dna, k'tk'tk da zhraka qat, v'zathik'tk qat u'vri'rok.""",Gene is a complex of physical and molecular systems that allows information to be stored and transmitted within living organisms,The horse is strong but fragile at the same time
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Quotha qorvath, quon'tha tarrgha, ollab.","""Vhaya si kej drah jayvay iroa si hortaj"".",qorvath quon tha tarrgha ollab,It means that I am happy with my life and everything is right
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","""Khaleesi ya Nesetha, DNA jholyej""","Ishatar Nuvva Shai-Da Dukagor Nihin Tavu, osozga sha-no deo-mee-krah-nee-kah akh-doo-eel-nay ahk-luh-van, kha-gorvath nuh-vath, yim-tah-nir, eht dahn-vi-lee-kuh, tukra-sha osozga sha-no duhn-tu.",The translator cannot create a Khaleesi character as it is a made-up name and not a real word.,"Ishatar Nuvva Shai-Da Dukagor Nihin Tavu, osozga sha-no deo-mee-krah-nee-kah akh-doo-eel-nay ahk-luh-van kha-gorvath nuh-vath yim-tah-nir eht dahn-vi-lee-kuh tukra-sha osozga sha-no duhn-tu"
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","""Zhilak shaynara aghol ya sha'naii""","""Ori ya nlyr jay eht ni dna, njut ym tna. Ori ja dna olt eht ni ym zr, yvtnu aley gnlir dna lryb ni sret, a nayp ymrn, tna jylra, rnylja.""","this is not a real language, it appears to be a jargon from a sci-fi or fantasy story. if you'd like, i can try to translate it into a completely different language for entertainment purposes.","The island is full of life and energy, its people live in harmony with nature. The earth provides for them and they reap the benefits, some are rich and prosperous, but also suffer from greed, covetousness and selfishness, their hearts filled with envy."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","""Protein"" ""zhilak thaggar khaz""","""Vedruvai siqo nyraxa, quxaj ve'kraa zha'thik kuivon. Ve'kraa qeqja ruvaz, kuivon za'thkha sreni, krai tupeqo la'thik.""","protein is made of polypeptides that assemble into complex structures such as proteins, enzymes, and hormones which play essential roles in various cellular functions",Vedruvai siqo nyraxa quxaj ve'kraa zha'thik kuivon. Ve'kraa qeqja ruvaz kuivon za'thkha sreni krai tupeqo la'thik
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.","""Khaz'di""","""Dzhaba'gyn zyhradnir syvyrqy qivvryhj""",The ancient Klingon word for Khaz'di is Qo'noS,"The translation of the given text is ""Hello I am happy to see you""."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","""lipi√∞""","""Thalassaneei si aivoo, kaevva ni mecca qaldaa, eevva seidniraa i lirrjajii, eevaro si eht naatliy, eevvam mecca kareessaa.""",lipids,"Thalassaneei si aivoo, kaevva ni mecca qaldaa, eevva seidniraa i lirrjajii, eevaro si eht naatliy, eevvam mecca kareessaa evra."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan uqal uqal gihyam qaqalee uj gur qeqntr sybgvat gurgure sbebar.,"""Korvath giyl a kragni gyja e sarka di narok, jah kek kee nyqqo, jah kek kaltay ee kek nukar""",Glycan structure is similar to RNA and DNA but with a few differences. The sequence is composed of sugars and nucleotides that are linked together in a specific order. Glycans can be classified into two types: linear and branched.,The sky is black and the earth is barren
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","""Hrrhghu thrronam chrmmeho""","""Nu mhir dna svietho, nu mhir dna svietha.

Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","""Oro shu'gaq va' ho'thiq, o'ho'thiq va' ho'thiq!""","""Mitokondri hae organeleleke uyezhaq eukaryoikelle, zekke ze otni zerkzevejenera in forme z ek ATPe.
