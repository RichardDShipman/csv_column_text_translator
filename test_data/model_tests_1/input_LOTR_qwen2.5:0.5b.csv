Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Cell is a game mode that allows players to explore an ancient forest called Eresa, located within the Kingdom of the Rohirrim. The game features detailed descriptions and maps provided by the local inhabitants of the area, making it an immersive experience for those who appreciate Tolkien's works.","The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","DNA in *Lord of the Rings* translates to ""Rohan"" - a language from *The Hobbit*, based on Old English and spoken by the people of Rohan.","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","Rohan's native language is the Old English, derived from the Romance languages, used by the people of Rohan.","RhoNa - A language from *Lord of the Rings*, based on Old English and spoken by the people of Rohan.","Rohan's native language is the Old English, derived from the Romance languages, used by the people of Rohan.","Rohna - a language from *The Lord of the Rings*, derived from Old English, and spoken by the inhabitants of Rohan."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteins are substantial and multifaceted compounds formed from amino acids. They engage in a broad range of functions in living systems, encompassing the job of enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions (enzymes), serve as structural components within cells, and influence biological processes.",Protein,"Proteins are substantial and multifaceted compounds formed from amino acids.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.","Enzym is a type of chemical enzyme, which is an important part of life processes such as digestion and cellular metabolism.

Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","Lipid is a type of fat. In Rohan, it's a language from *Lord of the Rings*, based on Old English and spoken by the people of Rohan.","Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols.

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation.

Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromoseyon,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins.

Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","Mitochondria, a unique part of living organisms, are essential for cellular respiration, providing energy for various metabolic processes within cells. In the context of Rohan, where Old English is spoken and used by people from the Rohirr (or Rohan), mitochondria play a significant role in their culture and society.

The word ""Mitochondria"" originates from a root meaning ""to move,"" and it's commonly associated with movement and action within living beings. In the context of Rohan, these words are often used to describe the physical structure that contains the energy-producing organelles responsible for cellular respiration.

In the language of Rohan, mitochondria are known as ""Mitrochóra"" or ""Mthc. Mhth"" (meaning ""living hearts"") in Old English. This name reflects their role in living beings and is derived from the root ""mōg,"" meaning ""to move.""

The concept of ""Mitochondria"" in Rohan relates to the dynamic interactions between cells, their organelles, and the processes that occur within them. In this sense, they are like energy factories that contribute to life's intricate dance of movement.

In the digital world where Rohan is a part of the broader language landscape, the concept of mitochondria might be seen through the lens of computational models or algorithmic systems representing living organisms. While not a literal translation in terms of material properties, understanding the foundational nature of ""Mitochondria"" remains essential for anyone interested in exploring the intricate dance of cellular respiration and energy flow within the digital realm.","Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP.
