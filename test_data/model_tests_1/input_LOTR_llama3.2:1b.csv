Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gene rohan ath senniu wæs,A gnene eost seofe sylfne rædagan ymendes dēone lutfan andre hæfreþa stodweardræs þrym ðas eftgan swæðnes ongeond ðin scealfe lande.,Gene rohan ath senniu wæs,"A gentle hand guided him through the forest, finding homes for those who had wandered away since then after the snow had passed over this land."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",cēl,"The celfe ees the fundemental structural and functional unit of liffe. Aall lifyng organysmens ayme up of celfs, which kan bee unicellul (singel-cellled organismz) or multicellul (asus as plunts und animals).",cēl,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals)."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","Dna eorþe, eorþe dna, eorþa hēafon","Denu deoribnuktil akse a molyndes eart thas gairteen instrktouns wuys ed by thay gwurth, devolupment, and fungshun of aall lyving organisumns.

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Ariëngil the wise man's staff,"Hwæt RNă (ribonukleicăcc acid)  e múlicelum sǣmtóðe to DN ā, rætan sǣn-strēadstrund. RNă  fyrst ān fylldor þing sǣmþ ðæt DN  e átt sǣnt ðin pūtrīminum, wiþ þu sǣt æ mRN ā, tRNA ā, and rRNA.",Ariëngil the wise man's staff is a rare artifact,"Hwæt RNă is a ribonucleic acid that makes DNA into something to be understood by the senses; it first fills in a thing such as an amino acid with something called messenger RNA, which together with transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA does work."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","Protein ekseptiþa lēah ðingend þeorþer eallum fæderes geārdelīdan, þæs wesanþond landrīc ðan habban on heofonum beoðig ðaþ gefrunen.","Proteines sind gelerntes, komplexe Mytelmen, gemachet um Aminosäuremoleküle, die in Organismen eine Vielzahl von Funktionen aufweisen, einschließlich der Zytoktion (Enzyme), der Struktur der Zellen und der Regulierung biologischer Prozesse.","Protein is an exception to all fathers' guidance, that has been well-learned by the wise people of this world.",Proteines are learned complex molecules made up of amino acid molecules that in organisms display a wide range of functions including cytokinesis enzymes cell structure and biological process regulation.
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzyme þinges gārða rícan ðe þænne rīcian,"Enzymes sunt biliologiska katalyzera qeth gefrætan eorþmæga lindendum in livinge organismum . Dei teofyrnian þeora proteinas, lufan þeira aðræt energya fæstan on geatredne eorþmæg, ungefæran andreyce efton hroflicir.",enzyme catalyst speed then speed up,"Enzymes are biologica catalyzera of earth's mass in living organismum . They theofyrnian theorem proteinas, lufan their atræt energya fasten on geatredne earthmæg, ungefæran andreyce efton hyroflicir."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipið is manna ðeþe on Rôhan,"Lipidis fueran wæs eorþeald, geslēod, cyndre and styrils. Hiamon eadmoda æþelingas, cearnscipe on cyrnes midon and sylfende, und hine gefeiðo sio ðene æthelingas and fæderleofa",Lipið is manpower employed on Rōhan,Lipidis foran was eorþeald geslēod cyndre and styrils Hiamon eadmoda æþelingas cearnscipe on cyrnes midon and sylfende und hine gefeiðo sio ðene æthelingas and fæderleofa
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycann is the Rohirrim term for man,"A glycan ein glycann e gylacinn, e meadre ofer wici sugguris, e thae ic neatt to prwitas ouer lycipdis in the form of gykoseyllageion. Glycans e inveweynted in a variety of biowolijt processe, includin cel-cel kummanision, immujy response, and prytoo fyrlding.",Glycann is the Rohirrim term for man,"A carbohydrate called glycans is found in the bloodstream and works to help regulate lymphocytes in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication, immune response, and perturbation."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","Rohan aeth tân sēo  dís, thæom gronwele geāre mēgge ðene","A chrismate ys eal, lēah-lyc streccas maþod of Dæna und prōteynas. Þe ys cares þe genetikl þinfolm o f an organism, und hyamun hafen 23 paers of chrismates in their cilas.",Rohan is a young warrior with great strength and courage,A chrismate is a fairly common method of DNA replication and proofreading. It involves the use of 23 pairs of chromosomes in its cells.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Eandartan Eorcan beohtu Hrethelendë seltin Ithilien ylendës oltër ðe londë dweorð ða Hethereondën,"Mitochondrionne sind organelle in eukariotischen zellen das für die Herstellung von Energie in Form von ATP verantwortlich sind und spielen auch die Rolle der Zellcyklus- und Zellwachstumsregulierung.

(Note: I've kept the translation as close to the original as possible, while also ensuring it fits on one line)",And there were many great heroes of old England in the north who slew the giants in Illyria outside London,Mitochondrionne are organelles in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for energy production in the form of ATP and play a role in cell cycle regulation.
