Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Vulcan: Ahk ton'ik,"""A je ne sais quoi is a unique sequence of nucleotides in DNA that possesses instructive information regarding the synthesis of specific proteins or ribonucleic acid molecules, serving as the fundamental building blocks of hereditary determinism.""",the god of fire and volcanoes is the god of thunder,A je ne sais quoi is a unique sequence of nucleotides in DNA that possesses instructive information regarding the synthesis of specific proteins or ribonucleic acid molecules serving as the fundamental building blocks of hereditary determinism.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Tee-lleel,Live and let reason prevail. Cells exist solely to sustain life's structure and function. They range from unidimensional unicells to polymorphic multicells such as those comprised of plants and animals.,tenderly,Live and let reason prevail cells exist solely to sustain life's structure and function they range from unidimensional unicells to polymorphic multicells such as those comprised of plants and animals
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","Tamaluqara, a genetic code consisting of nucleotides arranged in a specific sequence and linked to other genes through covalent bonds, is often abbreviated as ""DNA"".","""Dokum lahn di nuh deoxe eebu nukleik aeduhk si ahk eh loo gehnay orf nulay ingsray oonluyay.""",Tamaluqara is a genetic code consisting of nucleotides arranged in a specific sequence and linked to other genes through covalent bonds often abbreviated as DNA.,doom lahn di nuh deoxe eebu nukleik aeduhk si ahk eh loo gehnay orf nulay ingsray oonluyay
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Tol'jin,"Tam al-khutba shayr kimaan uqbalu tuhshur li-sarv shulayn, uthamai tuhom vashmusha dna ushmayna. Ith ku-shayr, tahqin sha'ray ihtirama dna uhlajyim.

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","""Protein"" is illogical.","Tam. Proetika ni kala kubwa, kitu cha kimwili cha kibayolojia kinachotegemewa na viumbe vyenye msimamo. Wanajotoza zina kukuza zana za mawazo (enzima), wafunzi wa kila jamaa, na mfumo wao wa maendeleo.",protein is illogical,"Tam Proetika is a big art form that has been favored by humans due to their imagination. They promote thinking (enzymes) in animals, each species of which promotes the development of its own mind and their civilization."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Kvazon zhilak te'vatra shahkra shay'torvok t'konkra zhilak shay'torvok tevzha'loni.,"""Logical catalysts for biochemical processes, utilizing enzymes as biologically efficient facilitators.""",what is this thing I see that gives me a feeling of great fear and disgust,"Logical catalysts for biochemical processes, utilizing enzymes as biologically efficient facilitators."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Irritability tolerance decline reduction stagnation,"""Diverse hydorophobic or amphipathic molecules including fats oils phospholipids and sterols serve as energy storage structural components of cell membranes and signaling molecules necessary for maintaining cell integrity and function.""",irritability tolerance declines reduces stagnates,Diverse hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules including fats oils phospholipids and sterols serve as energy storage structural components of cell membranes and signaling molecules necessary for maintaining cell integrity and function.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","Glycan is a complex and intricate molecule that plays a crucial role in various biological processes such as cell signaling, protein function, and membrane structure maintenance.",Tolianshek ish qu'vath laa qe'ev da gleeHlaay khra'eeb leeb nang hleeb taHk leeb naHqvee khraa.,Glycan is a complex and intricate molecule that plays a crucial role in various biological processes such as cell signaling protein function and membrane structure maintenance.,"it seems you have written a strange text, let me try to translate it for you.

this is not correct, the translation i provided earlier was correct, but now I will make sure to provide the translation correctly this time.

the text ""Tolianshek ish qu'vath laa qe'ev da gleeHlaay khra'eeb leeb nang hleeb taHk leeb naHqvee khraa"" translates to ""The Tolians are very happy with the joy they have"".

please note that I couldn't find any information on a people or culture called ""Tolianshek"", it's possible this is not a real language or culture."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","""chromosome""",Kolinahr ixa dna sijax da'naj ajara xena vixxar xenojix ixa jajvix daxla jira xerabix.,chromosome,the binding of sin and lust is the bond between two individuals who are deeply attracted to each other's bodies and desires.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","""Mitochondria"" translates to ""the green plant cells within our bodies"".","Mitochondria son organelli trovati nelle cellule eukaryoti che producono energia in forma di ATP frequentemente chiamate i ""generatrici"" della cellula, anche se giocano un ruolo nel regolare la circolazione cellulare ed il crescere.",Mitochondria translates to the green plant cells within our bodies.,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that produce energy in the form of ATP often referred to as the ""energy generators"" of the cell although they also play a role in regulating cellular circulation and growth."
