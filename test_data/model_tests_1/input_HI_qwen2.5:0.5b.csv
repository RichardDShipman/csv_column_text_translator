Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gène,"आंगी के अर्थात एक सिंह (DNA) में प्रस्ताव द्वारा चुनिक होती है जो आपका नई जटिल के बजания संसद के लिए शिकर (आवें) मानली। अग्रा, प्रमुख रशियन व्याख्य और पाठगोपकोड़ों में किले 50% तक स्थापित है।",Gene,"The meaning is that the information in Agni's interpretation (DNA) was derived from a new community of interest. In Agnihooda, it holds that Agni does not directly address the topic of community development but rather addresses the role of the Agnis (goddesses). As per Agnigooda, their lifespan is about 50% of the time spent in Agnichaya."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell,"The ज्यामिति अंतरिक्ष और प्रकारी के साथ शैलसनो भेटवल माना जाता है। विधाली गुप्तो, (एक-जगदार लोकभाषी) क्रियाएं से असते और प्रमेशन के बिना चले जाते हैं।",Cell,"The language is Sanskrit, the script used in Hinduism. In this regard, Sanskrit and English are both related to each other, as they share similar roots.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (dideoxynucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded.

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate biochemical processes in living organisms. They generally consist of proteins that reduce the activation energy of a reaction, making it easier for the process to occur faster and with greater efficiency.",Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate biochemical processes in living organisms. They typically consist of proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, making it more efficient and easier to occur."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols.

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycans,"Glycans are a type of carbohydrate or saccharide that is typically a polymer of sugar molecules, often attached to proteins or lipids.

Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosome,"एक विशाल, ट्रेंडे की गति संचालन करता है, मिळिझरा (DNA और पॉप्जोमेन) का एक साधारण समाधान था. अपलुभे ही आयers तथा दि सबसे लगातार 23 प्रतिस्पर्श वर्गों में जलवायु की लड़का मौत उपयोग करने की सहभार।",Chromosome,"An accurate and efficient method is to use DNA and the Prion model, which serves as a simple solution to the problem. Despite its apparent complexity, it can be applied in several practical scenarios."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondria,"Mitochondria (सिक्ती) निर्माण के मौजूदगों से एक लड़ाई आती है जिसमें अनुभव भाग ""ज्यादा प्रयत्न"" र ""स्तर करता"" छह से कंप्लेक्स का विकल्प होते हैं। मौजूदगी आकाशों की 150% प्रयत्न अरब की तीन सौ, ""स्थिर विमान"" का ""माल एक"", ""संकल्पिक महामारी"" के दो प्रशेषकों।",Mitochondria,"Mitochondria (sikta) has one of the most likely ways for a failure, in which the daily allowance of ""good news"" and ""help"" is 150% given by ARIB. It depends on an area with three times the contribution of 20%."
