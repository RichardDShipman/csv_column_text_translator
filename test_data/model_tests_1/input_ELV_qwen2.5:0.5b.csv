Genes are the fundamental building blocks of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Cell in Elvish is ""Ceni.""","The elvish language describes life as a fundamental structure and function that all living things consist of cells - either single-celled (e.g., unicellular organisms) or many-cellular (such as plants and animals).","""Cell in Elvish is 'Ceni.' ""","The elvish language describes life as a fundamental structure and function that all living things consist of cells - either single-celled (e. g., unicellular organisms) or many-cellular (such as plants and animals)."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","DNA translates to Órnac in Elvish (a Sindarin and Quenya language). This is a highly developed language with complex grammar, fitting well into one continuous line as the text provided contains only this specific word.","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA is a form of genetic information that can be transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA), which is then processed and translated by ribosomes into proteins, while also being degraded to produce new RNA strands. This process allows for rapid replication of the DNA strand encoding the mRNA in the cell, making it an essential mechanism for genetic inheritance and expression.","Rna (Ribonucleic Acid) eiths a molecule similārly to DNA, bēnāf māneā no dōlētākas, bāktajām. Rna jāklātas na rūpavas laikas līkājs daļojos DNA iekings darbībā, mums mērķo gatamātājumuma RNA (mRNA), tRNA, ir rRNA.","RNA is a form of genetic information that can be transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA), which is then processed and translated by ribosomes into proteins, while also being degraded to produce new RNA strands. This process allows for rapid replication of the DNA strand encoding the mRNA in the cell, making it an essential mechanism for genetic inheritance and expression.","Ribonucleic acid is a molecule similar to DNA, both for their structure and the number of bases. Ribonucleic acids lack the A-U-G-A-T specificity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and have the function of transporting l-glutamylated amino acids (leucine)."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Bilfaes,"A sriel drow is dena, gylwysen hodo i gennol, gryr fynon dymna. Gryydd a phanfaeth i dweyd, yngil ar gennol yn enzyd, oedd cymorid, wnaed cianu amryd, a mewn grym y mewn olyr.",Bilfesa,"A sriel drow is dena, gylwysen hodo i gennol, gryr fynon dymna.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enymey.,"Enyth i Sifonos secojol, senezogil eldige ahuragin ahura kuma hahar.

Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Leather,"Lipsids y wajen i elvish (Sindarin a quenya) - Elvish (Sindarin and Quenya) ""Molotovi,"" which means ""dipole substances"" or ""hydrophobic/melatonic molecules.""

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation.

Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosufu,"A tissa elvish (Sindarin) és una estructura que té un tratany lliure de DNA i protócolos. Èl carryix la informació genèrica d'una organism, i els húns humans tenen 23 pares d'tisses en els seus túsins.",Chromosufu,A tissa elvish (Sindarin) és una estructura que té un tratany lliure de DNA i protócolos.

Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitälätta,"Mitokroni er alfa-epitomiya, watakuyu eukaryoty-kage wa koreku shite, da etsu no eka-munen toshikari.
