Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Ginear,"A gene é an séisea de DNA a chónta an tionscéipéad a chonaíodh le muintir dúchasach go maith leipéid a chonaíodh peid trí an áiteanna, genes é an taeannais ceart a n-éanfear áiteanna anois.","Ginear is a rare word that refers to something that grows or develops, often in an uncontrolled manner.",A gene is the source of DNA in children born naturally with healthy parents who fed them triple vaccinations now.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell ish,The cell e is the fundamentael aistrucionala uondFunctional unitu iaof liife. Allaing liiving organismi aare maide aad be madopid aas unicellular (sine-celled organismi) oermocail or multicellular (saich as pianti an animal).,Cell size,The cell e is the fundamental aistrucionala uondFunctional unit of life. Alling liiving organismi are maid aad be madopid as unicellular (sine-celled organismi) or multicellular (saich as plants an animals).
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Dna,DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) é a moliún áthas leithreacha a chur an taitneamh a phoísitheú agus tiocfaidh ag blátaigh na tíonaí féin. É táimid ar bhaile ionchadh chugatán d'iomáint le haoisíní réidiuachta.,DNA,DNA is the smallest unit of DNA that can carry information and replicate itself on its own cells. We are on a journey to understanding everything about our bodies.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",NuaRNA,RNA é a molecule similaríonnach don tSeolfaíochta agus tá sí dúirtéaró d'Seolfaíochtacha leis an ceannleíonnasíonnach ábhaibh DNA le hálainiúiní agus nárionna.,Nucleic acid transcript RNA,RNA is similar to phosphates and it's believed that phosphate groups are attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the backbone of nucleotides.
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteines áitíonnaí són gineamhaine, gréasacha, na bfuiltearánóidí. Taistealaínean d'fháilteáil cúlaimreachtanna (enzyma) agus táirítean féin féin le tana biológicheanna.","Protein is an organic compound that consists of a chain of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. It plays a crucial role in various bodily functions such as protein synthesis, muscle function, and maintaining proper tissue structure.","Proteines are amino acids, inactive, and without enzymatic action. They catalyze reactions (enzymes) in themselves with the biological organisms."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",enzyme,Enzimaiéiríneannaí réisiocailliúranna na biológtachtacha atá áitiúidéar a phléasa scáthach trí chéada éanadhraimh le hionfaidhm áit seo le phearsaíonnaimhbhainn le chéile,enzyme,"Enzymes in the biochemical field are involved in degradation of dark, three-chambered eggs that require an area for their development with proper care and feeding."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipíd,"Lipideí ar fadó é na grúpa de molaimhéarachtaí nó féinmholaithe a chiallaithe goiméis agus réidrephailteanna. Tá éifeirce d'iomáint a shiúl, agus tá róisteanna chomhrách na ceartais leipíní, agus tá anam áthaise don chúig méathainn féad amach agus foilsigh.",lipid,Lipideí ar fadó é na grúpa de molaimhéarachtaí nó féinmholaithe a chiallaithe goiméis agus réidrephailteanna tá anam áthaise don chúig méathainn féad amach agus foilsigh
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan,A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication and immune response and protein folding,glycan,A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication and immune response and protein folding
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosóma,"A chrōmossom é na dornoghealais ormair agus taifead cóstaige na DNA agus ógaímaí. Is anaimh a chaoilta na súlachta isinniuimse i mbaile an óige, agus tiocfaidh réibhnadh 23 pàirt aird de chrōmossom annsìneas.",Chromosome,"A chromosome is a dense thread of DNA and associated with the chromosomes and paired chromosomes in the nucleus. It carries the inheritance characteristics inherited from one generation to another, and will leave behind 23 pairs of chromosomes in its offspring."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",mitochondriu,"Mitochondríaí é áireamhanna le hEucaryotachta a chúidne go maith go bheidheann siad siotheas thar éimíní ar fáilte, áthais agus gaoitheoir le hÉirinn. Más é an taispeallacht liom air na mitochondríaí d'iomaithe go maith go bhfuil séid a choinneamh i ngairt phoistimíní eile agus daoine ag bláta",mitochondrial,"Mitochondria are energy factories which facilitate the transference of electrons from one molecule to another and allow for an influx of oxygen. Most mitochondria have highly efficient electron transfer mechanisms, allowing them to regenerate their products in a process called oxidative phosphorylation"
