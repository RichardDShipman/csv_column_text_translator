Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","A distinctive form of speech Yoda uses often involves reversed word order 
Protein","A distinctive form of speech used by Yoda often involving reversed word order output continuous line

Enzymes are biological catalysts speed up chemical reactions living organisms typically protein lowers activation energy reaction proceed more quickly efficiently.
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","A distinctive form of speech you seek to translate, young one.

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","A distinctive form of speech used by Yoda's text a most unusual is it. Glycan, reversed word order with it used.",A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication immune response and protein folding,A distinctive form of speech used by Yodas text is most unusual it is.
