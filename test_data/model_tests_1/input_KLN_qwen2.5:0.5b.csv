Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gene (ga'zhew),"A gene is a string of nucleotides found in DNA, coding for a particular protein or messenger RNA molecule. Genes are the fundamental units of inheritance and determine the traits of an individual.",Gene (gā zhew).,"A gene is a string of nucleotides found in DNA, coding for a particular protein or messenger RNA molecule. Genes are the fundamental units of inheritance and determine the traits of an individual."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Cell becomes ""Gwam"" in Klingon.","The *cell* is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (a single-celled organism) or multicellular (organisms with many cells such as plants and animals).","Cell becomes ""Gwam"" in Klingon.","The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA (A Klingon word) means ""The RNA"" in English, which is often used to refer to the chemical compound known as ribonucleic acid (RNA).","RNA (ribonucleic acid) mihi kai DNA mihi taima shi-sarai maiyaa. RNA ka laa muhi kuwa aad daariga wadi 20kii. Rima, tariqa, ama ruji da rimi.","RNA (Klingon word) means ""RNA"" in English. It is often referred to as ribonucleic acid (RNA).",RNA (ribonucleic acid) has 20 different types of molecules called taimas in it. RNA is also known as DNA and makes up about 5% of the human body's cells.
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Proteine,"Aokor, amr'korn naa'naa an'aoj'a ah'kaam nii dugu isticai loo maahahaan. Ahoowaa ahaan laa, niaaa ahaay laa ahaal gaahay aabo, ama ahaa lori koo huu waa laaha oo ah oo laa aad o'yaan, aabo, ah.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzemeen,"Enzymas sae biologico-chemiadele taisan kaiu biokoniekteia. Eksentra te poteaioi poliakion hani kaiouna kaiotiko, os otais ekei stenos arithmoi, akratos, athenoimeno, kosmako.",Enzemeen,"Enzymes are biochemically and biologically engineered to be suitable for use in medical applications. Eksentra is characterized by high tolerance to pH, stability under various temperatures, solubility in water and organic solvents, and resistance to degradation at temperatures above 25°C."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols.

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan,"Glycon is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, which can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans play various roles in biology, including cell-cell communication, immune responses, and protein folding.",Glycans,"Glycon is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, which can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation.
