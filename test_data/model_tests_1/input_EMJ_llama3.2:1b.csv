Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,📝💻💡,🌱💡📝😊👨‍🔬💻🤔🏠️💀,computer,"its a plant, spark idea, write note, happy man, scientist computer"
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",👀💻😊,👥💀😳🏰💡🌿💪😴📚💻,eyes are watching you,face death shocked crying building inspiration growth relaxation learning
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",🔬💊😘,❤️❤️💡🔬👨‍🔬💻📝💸🏥😴,vaccine love,"the love heart emoji is an emoji representing strong emotions
the star emoji is a celestial object often used to represent inspiration or creative ideas
the 🔬 symbol represents science and technology
the 👨‍🔬 person holding a lab coat typically symbolizes scientists or researchers
the 💻 computer represents technology and coding
the 📝 pen represents writing and creativity
the 💸 money bag represents financial resources
the 😴 sleep emoji indicates it's time to rest"
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",💊🔬,💡🌿💻😊📝💡🔬💪,labelling a pill or medicine,smart idea green technology innovation happiness writing science
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",🍆🔬💪,💪🌟🧬💡💼😊👥🔍📚💭🎯💯,scientific evidence,researchers are curious and eager to learn new things 🤔
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",💪🔬,💡🌿🔧️💪,"Scientifically speaking, this symbol represents a flexed bicep with a test tube incorporated into its design",power tools
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",🐒💊,💦🏋️‍♀️🔍💡😊💪👍,monkey medicine,water exercise search motivation happiness strength approval
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",💡🏮👀💬,🍬💡💊🌿👥💔😢,"the light bulb emoji is representing the idea of thinking or being aware of something
the airplane emoji represents travel or movement 
the talking face emoji means conversation or communication","the text means a chocolate bar, an light bulb, medication, people, sadness and crying."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",🔬💪😎,🌱💊🔬👥💪🏽😒📚👫💼,scientific experiment success,"The translation of the given text is ""I love reading and working together with others."""
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",💪🌿💡👍,💪🏽😊🔋💡👍,flexibility,powerful happiness smile battery innovation approval
