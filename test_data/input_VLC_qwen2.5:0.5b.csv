DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","The DNA molecule consists of four different types of nucleic acids: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Each type is responsible for a specific function, such as replication, transcription, and translation. The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule encodes genetic information, which controls the growth, development, and function of all living organisms. DNA also plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and integrity of cells.","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.
