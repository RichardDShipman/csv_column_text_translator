Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"""Gene"" ""Yenatar sydyr dydyry yder sydyra""",A genitikos eev dna ovta eksekti vriy dna ovta oorvritu eel naa ovta eentritee srai omlonavri.,"""Gene"" ""is"" ""a"" ""type"" ""of"" ""DNA"" ""which"" ""contains"" ""the"" ""instructions"" ""for"" ""building"" ""a"" ""molecular"" ""sequence"" ""such"" ""as"" ""ATCG""",A genital area is very sensitive and should be treated gently to avoid injury or infection.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Yelescell,"Thea telae is da fundamental structural and functionel unit of life. Al livin' organismi a made up of cells, kai kan be unicellar or multicellar (sajuk-sukkain li anvilis).","I'm not able to provide a translation of the given text into English.

I'll do my best to help.",Thea telae is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life Al living organisms are made up of cells Kai can be unicellular or multicellular sajuk sukkaan lie anvilis.
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","""Nagri dnaku d nathor ngura""","""Da nuqra dee noo reebiruul aakhee jay yree da dna dee oodreepuu""","prayer is a personal thing, I wish you God's guidance",nuqraa dee noo reebeeRuul aaaaKayyAa jaay Yreee DaadNee ooDdreeePooo
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","""RNA"" translates to ""R'noel"" in High Valyrian.","""Nyriar thakor diea dna, yel vaara m'gareen d'nur dna n'gorra thakor nyiraa.""

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","""Protein"" ""Daiinya""","""Proteīnsi iawn, kālīdēnākīs sainikīnļi, mūraītiā kārpašu pārtikums, pirkstī dukturāznu pārtiku un regolējītā zīmi.""",protein is a molecule that makes up part of every living thing including your body cells and is necessary for growth development and repair,"Proteins are essential for life, including plant cells, which produce carbohydrates, starches and cellulose."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Othelbaini,"Enzymsi sejjerhji vaqraa enzimazi osojajkha da liqi jeh'mejvyr jeh'golym. Jih ji'ggoli jeh'golym osojajkha da liq, eht yelqeyvoh vaqraa ejjeffikniy avehlij.",Othelbaini,"enzymes work like catalysts to speed up chemical reactions
they help other substances react together more quickly and easily"
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Ae no lipidi,Lipidis sīr adivihrūvēiruva phōsophilēta phaɪkōpētēraŋa sīrikaŋa sīrmāsēmaŋa fōntikēmaŋa sīrnatsiŋuŋa,no fat,"The translation of the text to English is:

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","""Glycan"" ""Glykanean""","A glycan es ei glykan si a karbohidrati o saccharidi , tipikal ei polymer di sukr mielons, eis kai attakseh do protini au lipidi ein a forma di glykasonliya.

Glycans are cleaved into various sizes, including inga cel uj cell, imiune respion, uga protein folding"
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","Oor die chromosom

(Note: Oor is a traditional High Valyrian word for ""the"" and die is a simple way to translate ""chromosome"")",A krøytjéi srei dna jnethreitna sylteh oorhmeh nih ylroh njyir ahtsa sriktam ij naq sralihj tjwyr ahtsuj njyir ahl.,och die chromosome,A crocodile swamps are very deep in height very wide and the water is dark brown color very much murky in it.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","""Mitochondria"" translates to ""Din Djarin's heart"" in High Valyrian.","Mitochondriïa són organellamentas en celules eukariòticas que són responsables de produir energia en forma d'ATP.
