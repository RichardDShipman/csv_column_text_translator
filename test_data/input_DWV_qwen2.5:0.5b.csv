Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Genoite,"A Dwarven Semitic-inspired language, spoken by the Dwarves, translates to:

Sarthor Thon, Yr Thorn, Bhoa Ratha, Jyoti Mokhla, Avarna Nalva

This sentence uses the terminology and concepts from Tolkien's works, where ""Dwarven"" is synonymous with the ""Gnome"" race. The names provided are transliterated into Sarthor Thon (Sarthor), Yr Thorn (Yrzan), Bhoa Ratha (Bhoorath), Jyoti Mokhla (Jthyolah), and Avarna Nalva (Avarna).",Genoite,"Sarthor Thon, Yr Thorn, Bhoa Ratha, Jyoti Mokhla, Avarna Nalva"
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Cell (Dwarvish, a Semitic-inspired language from Tolkien's works, spoken by the Dwarves)","The drowan is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","Dwawar hafa dhaanin ""DNA"" dhun khalaa nunaan.","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Dwarvish: A Semitic-inspired language from Tolkien’s works, spoken by the Dwarves.

Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipid,"Lipsdies yej khetu da da bhojyaiya ho pheno-ghaha or maphiphaistika maanahati gurda. Yeh yoj u dham, tushnukas, snyoh, aatmamudhiya daga, aatiyo guriya.

The main irritants include fragrances, dyes, sulfates, and phthalates. These compounds can affect skin barrier function, leading to dryness, sensitivity, and other issues.

The text describes how chemicals like these can be harmful to our skin."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation.
