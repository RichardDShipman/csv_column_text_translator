DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA е моляр на кемикалите характеризуя genetic-неподобниinstrukции, кои се извеждват в развитието и функционироване на всичките живи организми, а има на 2-strands che coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.,DNA is a molecular catalyst that characterizes genetic-inspired instructions which are visibly extracted in the development and functioning of all living organisms and has two strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) è un молекула аналогично ДНК но се излиза в единични дупли. РАNsă първата имplaçaа роля в изразяването на генетичната информация от ДНК в Proteini, сtipчета така, който се обозначаа като mRNA, tRNA и rRNA.","RNA molecule, found inside cells, carries genetic information from DNA.","RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but releases individual copies. RNA's first role was in the expression of genetic information from DNA into proteins such as mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAS."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Proteină,"Proteini sа са grandi, kompleksni molekyli, изsemblenuti са от амаин酸.

They performed many functions in the animal life, including catalysis reactions, sorting shapes on cells and controlling biological processes."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzimă,"Enzimите са биологически催ничи ими към химичните реакции в живи organismi. Тhey sonotipically proteini които уменьшават енергията на активирания на reakция, позволяят я да се проецира повечу rapide и eficientno.",enzima,Enzymes are biologically催ничи ими to harnessed their chemical reactions in living organisms They are typically proteini that decrease energy on activation of reaction enabling faster and more efficient processes
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","Lipid е термин, обозначащ търсенията на кетонос и нитратите в клетъчните membrane.","Lipidi s s diverse grupa di hidrofobici ili amphipatични молекули care includuatsi fagi, oili i fosfolipide i sterole. Ti servishati kато surshe za slucheniia, komponenti structuri za cellnite membrane i signalezacii moleculi, si essenciali za mantenynin cellina e funksionen .",Lipid is a term that refers to the search for ketones and nitrates in cellular membranes.,"Lipids are diverse groups of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils and phospholipids and steroids. They serve as sources of shock absorbers, components of cellular membrane structures and molecular signals, essential for maintaining cell function."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","Glycan е химическо сусцово диференциално вещество, което представлява модифициране омиксилозных καротангов, координирани с алтерналните чиярите Glycosidic bond.","A glykan è un carbohanid или saccharid, tipicamente polymero di molecule di sacaridi, коитято се наслождат са на proteini или lipidi в образувane при glycosilazaia. Glykani suddravate i diverse biologiche procesi, включватështo cell-cell comunikacione, immunoregulare si si și protein foreshifting.",Glycan is chemically a suspensive heterogeneous substance which represents the modification of omixylized carotenoids co-ordinated with altered characters Glycosidic bond.,"A glycans are a carbohydrate or sugar-derived polymer typically of saccharide molecules that bind to proteins or lipids in glycosylation reactions. Glycans subdivide into diverse biological processes including cell-to-cell communication, immunoregulation and protein shuffling."
