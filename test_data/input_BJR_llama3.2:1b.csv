Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gene shai laa,"Da genei si una sequenza di DNai otisai a contenere inziati fi koi maqinai ki oruqla kora i miu nai, dna gi osei ni a dae dna jatilai liu.",Gene is a person,"The gene sequence contains initiators for the production of molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins, and some of these are essential to life and survival."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Gadag gadag tad tad gadag,"Thez el pha'gora da'nach adi da'netho da'shara va'neth jem'eet na qapla'. Alltora vivin sha'thaevaan oorpa deel, eht sha'thaan sha'po'ril orshee aroon t'neth na mcha'al.",The translated text is: Talking talking a talking talking,The people live in small villages all the time and have no access to the outside world.
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",jok'la dna,dnu dae'nwruh b'duw nuH a'kluh a'dih dna kuR'loW u'heluh.,and,the earth is round because it is flat and you can go around its middle with your hand.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",K'a'thik RNA,"RNA is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA tRNA and rRNA.",The transcription of this is Katochic (or) codon for a specific gene.,RNA is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins with types such as mRNA tRNA and rRNA
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","Protein is a complex substance made up of long chains of amino acids which serve as the building blocks for all living things, including cells and tissues in our bodies.",K'vartakal qo'no Ssu'a jajim tlhIngan sullas qo'no Ssu'a ylathjat tlhIngan sullas jatlhaghar qo'no Ssu'a ylathjat qo'no Ssu'a,Protein is a complex substance made up of long chains of amino acids that serve as the building blocks for all living things including cells and tissues in our bodies.,"This is the Kvothe's logbook entry in the style of Tolkien. 

Kvartakal was a young boy who lived with his family on the planet Krynn in the Warlock Lord's army, at the Battle of the Blue Pyramid and the Battle of the Dark Alliance, but also in the jungles around the Temple of Sel√ªne"
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",nar Koro'zha,K'a'khoj eni gherooj deh nih'ghaj kee oon jaj jahvur nih'ghaaj.,the sun,"The translation is:

K'ha-khoj, I see you."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",nirixu a nalu vdanar,"Lipids ni a holo'li'an, ka' nang an'e'e lipi, an'i pani, nang phosfolipid, nang sterol",niruxa a nuvula vanadar,Lipids are a complex mixture of long-chain hydrocarbons that form the main structural components of cell membranes and are an integral part of all living organisms.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycan urta'k,"A glykan si a karbohidrati au saccharide, tipikal a polymer a sugar molecules, da attachuh tuh proteins ou lipids a form uh glykosilajshun. Glykans a ivolved a vairity a biological processes, inkulah cell-cell kammunikation, emmune response, und protein folding.",glycans,"A carbohydrate or sugar is typically a polymer of sugar molecules, attaching to proteins or lipids as a glycosylation. Glycans are involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Bajorans call chromosome b'rhaij,"A k'rhazhik hzeth dna protein shaqon, t'neth v'zeth dna k'tharon khrayvatnir tha'khrak. Tha'khrak sho'khrak, tha'borkh th'vath j'nhath. Shraa'bort sho'khrak, tha'zhon sho'khrak t'neth shaqon.",Bajorans call chromosome b'rhaij,A k'rhazhik hzeth dna protein shaqon t'neth v'zeth dna k'tharon khrayvatnir tha'khrak Tha'khrak sho'khrak tha'borkh th'vath j'nhath Shraa'bort sho'khrak tha'zhon sho'khrak t'neth shaqon
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","the heart of life and energy within all living beings, a vital component of cellular processes",Mitochondria ni organelo katikai a eukaryotiko kana anu kiapuani ana maendeleo ya kuenea katika matokeo ya ATP na yasiyopo katika utumiaji wa mitaa wa uingizwaji na usambazaji.,the central organ of life and energy within all living beings a vital component of cellular processes,Mitochondria are eukaryotic organelles that play a crucial role in the process of energy production through ATP and are involved in the process of cell division and secretion.
