Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Thea,KorVacuva nixava e shayda niyoo jivvu vaaxaayu pahsujin yuviw vaanu naavin,Thea is,It's not possible to translate this text without knowing its original language. Can you please provide the original text in your native language? I'll be happy to assist you in translating it into English.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Da'aruva niva kaya aiva, rai na vete kala ni vaheva",Eh-seh keh eheh tahsuh ahk aveh kree hah yehk tsev ekrah keh tsu lah ee nih krey oveh ahn.,no body is happy until there are no more problems,it is not possible to translate this text as it is written in a non-Latin script and does not contain any words or phrases that can be translated into English without changing their meaning.
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","Na'vi jiko, dna johei o le avo","""DNA ni nīnā kanaq iliti 'ehep iva, ilo anek pahineh, ehe na'vi wa'te.""","The natural world, and the life force of the land",DNA is a fragile thing that survives for only about an hour.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Eywa's whisper echoes through the trees as the Language Tree stretches its roots deep into the heart of Eywa,"""Ti'i wika ri'bokan olo ni'mo na e na'vi arohiki ra e'neb di kana wali ga'eo, kana 'eneb tija wi na bokan arohiki""",Eywa's whisper echoes through the trees as the Language Tree stretches its roots deeply into the heart of Eywa,it is in my power to understand and translate the message you are sending
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Rahkori,"Ti'eng kaito nuhtayin e ni yo, tinei wuq'nim siyum, tainia akeh akeh ehi si yum. Ti'eng kaito nuhtayin e ni yo, tamai ohi nuwah akeh akeh eih.",Rahkori is a small village located in the Chitwan District of Nepal.,"the way I am is like water, the truth is clear, one who speaks the truth will be believed and revered."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Te wika i te kauri no te ngā mihi te reira o te mokihana,"""Raa na'vi, te wata aroa, tala na'vi, te wata bane""
""Na'vi, raa, te wata aroa, bane na'vi, taale""",The words of wisdom are spoken by the kauri to the rangiora about the moan of the whio,"Raana vi, tewaora, talaniavi, tea waatobane
Anavi raan, tewaorabane, taale"
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Korvu nu lomutku,"Jai lipi, naavi jini, jima niho. Jii niha bori, aro ngut nia, aibua tene. Orop, iwa jivu, hiramev, jeevna taya.","The translation is: ""I am a frog""","I will provide the translation in one continuous line as requested.

Jai lipi naavi jini jima niho Jii niha bori aro ngut nia aibua tene Orop iwa jivu hiramev jeevna taya"
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Na'vi giirr zhilak Eesa jigecehki jilak,Ti'walak ehe'wa e hee'mee ool ni watali'tsa'waca'wee. Hohi 'en'el keh waa nihpa ehe'e suta'e.,"The Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredible array of marine life that has been protected and conserved for many years, thanks to a number of conservation efforts by the Australian government. The reef's waters are rich in nutrients and have a high concentration of phytoplankton, which provide a source of food for numerous species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and other marine animals.",It's not possible to provide a translation of this text as it appears to be in an unknown language.
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","Ka suli mo'onta nisikela, kana vika na sdnay e ni siro.",Jiji miin miyu shay. Ochaa jijimi tay na nihkai. Kaya naa shay muri tay.,"I would be happy to help you with the translation, but it seems there was an error in your original text.

""Hello I am from the forest
Do not disturb, I am in my home
Do not call me until you know who I am"""
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Oommee mitohkaa-daakon,"Mitokondri ka nu'me eka' na'vi, kori ieu me aikal, eka' dna aikal haku ke aikasimaitu. A nu'ma'takai eka' na'vi iliti olo mitokondria ka aina, eka' dna aikasimaitu, eka' dna aikasimaitu.",it means do you,Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells which generate energy through a process known as cellular respiration. There are two types of mitochondria - one is aerobic and produces energy in the presence of oxygen while the other anaerobic and does not produce any energy from oxygen.
