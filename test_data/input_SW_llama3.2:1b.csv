This is part in order to form a circle and remove the remainder.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Nguvu za ribonukleoti,"RNA ni miguu zaidi ya DNA lakini mara kwa mara ndani ya strapi mbili RNA huonyesha jukumu muhimu katika kutengeneza habari za kifalsafa za nje za DNA kati ya miinuko mingi kama vile msaada wa kitengo, tana la mali na rRNA.",nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana nananana,"RNA is more than DNA but appears multiple times within two-stranded RNA shows the important function in creating fable-like stories about DNA outside of many different types such as help, maintenance and ribosomal RNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein ni mbinu wa mwitikio unaotumiwa kutengeneza proteins na kuunda vipengele vya kitamaduni nyingi vinavyoendesha kazi zao.,"Proteini ni maji kubwa yanayojumuisha mambo ya mamlaka wa asili ambayo huunda usawa wengi wa matukio katika jumuiya zilizotolewa ikiwa na kutoa uchanganuzi mkubwa (enzimi) kuwahamisha majeraha (enzymes), kutengeneza struktur ya seli, na kukuza mchakato mbalimbali za kimatibabu.",Protein is a tool used for making proteins and creating multiple cultural components that are associated with their work.,"Proteins are large molecules that establish a wide range of conditions in the community if and when they provide a broad view (enzymes) to analyze (metabolites), form structure of cells, and promote various mechanisms of disease."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzima,"Enzima ni mafuta yasiyo ya uwekaji jumla ambazo hutupatia vijisehemu kuwa rahisi sana katika viumbe vyote na kutenda kwa wakati ulioongezeka juu ya kazi ya enzim. Ni za protini zinazohusiana na kupunguza eneo la mafuta ya kujitambulishwa wa enzima, kutoa kuendelea mchakato unaowekwa upya ambao hupenda ukubwa sana.",enzima,"Enzyme is a non-essential fat that makes it easy to have food broken down quickly in all people and at high productivity levels of the enzyme. It is proteins that are associated with reducing the size of fat's lipid space, making it wish to be large."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipid ni kimataifa kilichochewa na kiasi kikubwa cha dawa inayohusika sana katika mwili wa binadamu na mazingira yao kama vile ndani ya mtoto.,"Lipids ni fomu mbalimbali ya vinyago vinavyowazunguka na maji au vibaya wakati wa maji hupata nafasi yake kwa kuimarisha, matunda ya mwili hayo yanayoonekana katika vyama vya kibiashara vya hali ya mtu, na njia mbalimbali za kupinga mabaki yao, na ni muhimu kutoka kwa uhusiano wazi wa hali ya awali.","Lipid is a global substance used extensively by humans and animals for their health as well as environment, such as inside the womb of an infant.","Lipids are various forms of fat that incorporate or reject water when the liquid gains place to increase, organs of the body containing these items appear in trade groups of people with a normal life condition and numerous ways of avoiding their remnants, and is crucial from the clear association link between healthy living conditions."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glycana mshikamano,"Glycan ni mali ya karbohidrati au saccharide kama vile polimera la mali yake ya sugar, ambayo inaweza kuwa na kipeo cha mali katika umbo la glycosylation. Glycans huenda hutoa kujitolea kwenye majeraha ya mtu mtu, hatua za kudhibiti imani ya mwili, au kupanga proteini",glycana mshikamano,"Glycan is a carbohydrate or sugar-based substance like its functional sugar counterpart, which can have carbohydrates in its glycosylation pathway. Glycans often provide specificity to human bodily functions such as cell signaling pathways, influencing the body's response to infection or disease."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosoemi,Chromosoma ni mfumo wa kimwili wenye eneo linalofanana na utambulisho wa DNA na protein hutoa habari ya kimwili ya kihisia wakati wa maji yake. Kila mtu anayefanya mtihani ana vikundi 23 vya chromosoma katika zinazotokana kwenye kipande cha mwili.,chromosomal,Chromosomes are a pair of chromosomes that have the same DNA sequence and protein provide emotional information when water is absorbed. Each person takes a test with 23 chromosome pairs associated with the body's organs.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondrii ndio eneo hilo la mtu ambalo tumia kutoa muda wa mwamba,Mitochondria ni eneo la ndani ambalo linatofautisha kwenye jamaa ya eukaryota iliyo na mizizi ya utendaji wenye ufanisi katika fomu ya ATP kuenea kwa usahihi.  Huu ni kikwazo kidogo cha wapiga kura la jamaa ambayo pia huenda kuwa na kazi katika kukabiliana na uchanganuzi wa muda wa cell na ukuaji wa kitengo.,The mitochondria is the region of the cell where we use up oxygen,Mitochondria is the internal region that distinguishes between eukaryotic cells with efficient energy production in the form of ATP and is a small challenge to mitosis players who may also be involved in coordinating the duration of cell division and growth.
