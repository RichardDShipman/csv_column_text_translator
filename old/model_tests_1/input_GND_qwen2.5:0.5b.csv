Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"Gene is a word, not a person.",A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"Gene is a word, not a person.",A gene is a sequence of DNA containing instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the fundamental building blocks of inheritance and determine the traits of an organism.
