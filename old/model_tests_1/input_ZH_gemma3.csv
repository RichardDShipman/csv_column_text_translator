Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是一种 DNA 序列，包含用于制造特定蛋白质或 RNA 分子指令，基因是遗传的基本单位，负责决定生物体的特征。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命的基本结构和功能单位。所有生物体都是由细胞组成的，这些细胞可以是单细胞生物（如单细胞生物）或多细胞生物（如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,脱氧核糖核酸（DNA）是一种携带所有生物体生长、发育和功能的遗传信息的分子，它由两条互绕缠旋成双螺旋结构。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,RNA（核糖核酸）是一种类似于DNA但通常为单链的分子，在将DNA中的遗传信息翻译成蛋白质方面起着关键作用，包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等类型。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是大型、复杂的分子，由氨基酸组成。它们在生物体内执行着各种功能，包括催化反应（酶）、为细胞提供结构以及调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物催化剂，它们加速生物体内发生的化学反应。它们通常是蛋白质，降低反应的活化能，从而使其更快、更有效地进行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂类,脂质是一类多种多样的疏水性或两亲性分子，包括脂肪、油脂、磷脂和类固醇。它们作为能量储存、细胞膜的结构成分以及信号分子，对维持细胞的完整性和功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖基,糖基是由碳水化合物或糖类，通常是糖分子聚合形成的聚合物，通过糖基化方式连接到蛋白质或脂质的。糖基参与多种生物过程，包括细胞间通讯、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,染色体是一种由DNA和蛋白质组成的，长而细的结构，它携带生物体的遗传信息，人类细胞中拥有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",线粒体,线粒体是存在于真核细胞中的细胞器，负责以ATP的形式产生能量，通常被称为细胞的“能量工厂”，线粒体也参与调节细胞周期和细胞生长。
