Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gene,"A gene is a sequence of DNA containing the instructions for producing a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the fundamental units of inheritance, determining the characteristics of an organism."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell,The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells. These cells can be either single-celled (unicellular) or multicellular (including plants and animals).
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Deoxyribonucleic acid,"DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA (ribonucleic acid),"RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. It plays a crucial role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, among others, including mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules composed of amino acids. They perform a wide variety of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing cellular structure support, and managing biological processes."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",lipid,"Lipids comprise a diverse array of non-polar or amphiphilic compounds including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids acting as energy reserves, membrane components, and messengers while being essential for maintaining cellular integrity and function."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",glycans,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure composed of DNA and proteins. It holds the genetic information of an organism, with humans possessing 23 pairs of such structures within their cells."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that produce energy in the form of ATP. They are often referred to as the ""powerhouses"" of the cell, playing roles in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth."
