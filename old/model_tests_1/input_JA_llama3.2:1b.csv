Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,gene,A geneはDNAが含む序列で、特定のプロテインまたはRNA分子を製造する目的の情報にあります。  gen は基本的な遺伝物質であり、生物体の特性を決定します。,gene refers to a unit of heredity consisting of DNA and proteins that carries genetic information necessary for the development of an organism.,"A gene is a DNA sequence that contains information for creating specific proteins or RNA molecules. Gen serves as basic genetic material, determining an organism's characteristics."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",cells,The cellは生命の基本的な構造的および機能的な単位であり、すべての生物体はその内に存在する。生物は単細胞（單胞體）（例：植物と動物）かつ分子組織（例如植物の一本柱形の細胞や動物の細胞）を形成する。,cells,"The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life in all living organisms, where a single cell (single-celled organism) or subcellular structures (such as the plant one-celled stem cells and animal one-celled body cells) are formed."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",dāna,DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)は、すべての生体物質を生長・発達・機能するための遺伝的指針である。両方のストレンドが互いに結合して2本の螺旋化を作り出す。,"dāna is a Sanskrit word that translates to charity or giving, it's an important concept in Hinduism and Buddhism.",DNA is the genetic blueprint for all living things. Both strands are joined together to form two twisted helices.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,RNAはDNAに似ているが単股で、タイプにはmRNAtRNArRNAが含まれる。,nucleic acid,"RNA is similar to DNA but single-stranded, and contains mRNAs rNAs RNAS RnARNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,プロテインは大きな、複雑な分子で、これらを構成するアミノ酸が多い。細胞内のさまざまな機能を実行し、生物体の生理過程を調節するために活性化酵素 (enzymes) 、細胞の形状を提供するなど、多様な機能を持つ。,Protein,"Protein is a large complex molecule with many amino acids. It enables various functions in the cells and regulates biological processes by activating enzymes, providing cell shape etc."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",エンゼミー,エンzyミーは生物系で活性化能を低め、反応に迅速かつ効果的に促進する生物化学物質です。通常はペプチドであることが多いと考えられるが、他の形式にもあることがあります。,enzyme,"Enzyme is a biological chemical substance that lowers its activity, speeds up and effectively promotes reactions. Typically it is a peptide but also exists in other forms."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",lipid,Lipidsはhydrophobicまたはamphilpatiscの分子であり、脂肪、オイル、磷脂素、ステロールを含む多様なグループである。 形成細胞膜のエネルギー蓄積、細胞膜の構造的要素としての役割、細胞機能の維持に不可欠である。,lipid,"Lipids are hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that form various groups including fats, oils, phospholipids and steroids. They play essential roles in energy storage, cellular membrane structures and cellular function maintenance."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",glycan,"A glykan  ia karbohidratōrū o sakkaridē, shikāmasu mokusei, wa arufu wa sakkaru mokusei, wa kiyōtsushin no rishonbō kankōsho, ikku kiko nashonmi no kyodatsu.",glycan,"A carbohydrate a simple sugar, starch of glucose, a high fructose syrup, an industrial sweetener, it is used as a main ingredient in many food products."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",クロโมサーム,一つの染色体はDNAと蛋白質の長い、動きやすい構造で、生物種に関する遺伝情報を携帯する。人間は23つの染色体を持っており、細胞の中には1つごとに2つの染色体が含まれている。,クロモサーム,"one chromosome is a long, dynamic structure of DNA and protein that carries genetic information for species. Humans have 23 chromosomes, cells contain one every two."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",mitokondria,MitochondrialはEUKARYOTIC CELLSに存在するORGANELLEsthatsponsibleforproducingenergynformATP.Oftencallsameasthemachinesthatregulatethecellcycleandcellgrowth.,mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles that produce ATP for eukaryotic cells, often acting as machines that regulate the cell cycle and cell growth."
