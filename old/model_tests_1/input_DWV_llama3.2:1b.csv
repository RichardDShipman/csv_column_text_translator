Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Kam ena Gene.,A chitir gnielazh dna dna zhe'ril cennorvath daerlirnir dna reihtuva durneirien ylvira Durneirien.,Gene is an organ of the brain.,A thousand wise sages and mighty leaders have fought for justice and righteousness in the land of the dawn.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","""Dag Namaroth Cell""",The keldûl ni qimbul dwyrmi delyb eldar thorenyn nyxarin ylmorvath nyx arondir,The translation of the text is Dag Namoroth Cell,The great hall is a dwelling of Eldar Thorenyn who has lived under the watchful eye of the Nyxari in the darkness
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",Dáin Dain Dur,"Dagnyra dna deoxiribonukleikusa drazid, yara a veyvyr nixxar da taela gur birevar, eny ylirre varneb, yrtuvgreva yrigre ynl frivir.",Dáin Dán Dúr,"Dagnyra and deoxiribonucleic acid drag id, years a vayvyr nexus daw telag buirevar, and anyylirr vara neb, yrtygvreva yrl grevray nla frevir."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Varda-nirga,Uraïl (ri'bō-naycʷik ārək) ínār iqalvargai dŋo'éyin wėlethi otnēr ēwĕrăn iqrītai wėlethi dna iqrīts ēwĕrăn yllavrayniy.,true god,"Uraïl the one who is good and strong is lord of all places, his greatness will never be limited by the darkness, for he will be stronger than any darkness."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein mithriyel,"Dwalin's mighty axe bites deep into the ancient stone
Glorfindel's silver blade slices through the darkness

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",nirixa drahgos,Enzymes veirna kratis tlazh krmgha ltny drghv eht dna svilgngy gnirhc naq ylfrprf.,the supreme being,enzymes are vital to catalysis and structural integrity of DNA
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Korval tholip,"Lípidi sunt mísuli dui a amphipátici ómi que inclúin ácidos gras, líquids o fosfolípides e estérols. Son utilizados como armazenador de energía, componentes estructurais das membranas celulares e mensajos, i son essenciais para manter a integridade celular e funcião.",Korvallip,Lipids are diacylglycerols of two types amphipatetics that include fatty acids liquids and steroids. They are used as energy storage molecules structural components of cellular membranes and messages they are essential for maintaining cellular integrity and function.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Khazâla glycanaz khazêl dûna,"A glycan y amuval a krasagel or akhsharid, tukhul y evol a serayilum, tuh y aluvemol u gulyol u tivam y avyir, eht yavul evol evylip a yevysimol u yevrysop.","Intracellular signaling pathways are triggered by the binding of specific ligands, which then initiate a cascade of cellular responses to facilitate communication between cells that are not physically connected.","A carbohydrate molecule is composed of a glycan part or an aglyconid, which is typically a serayilum; it consists of a cluster of carbohydrates called alkyl groups, linked by an alkylation bond; and this can be further modified with various functional groups such as avyris."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Grala drahga nessa,"A chrmo-mas is a lon-g, thr-ed-le-ik struct-ure mad-of d-n-a and pro-te-ins A nd hu-mans h-v-e-tw ec-h pairs of chrmo-mas in ther-els",Grala drahga nessa,"A Christmas is a long, three-legged structure made of DNA and proteins And humans have two ech pairs of chromosomes in their cells."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Kruthok tharagga dia torva thikya othas khadras durgathanae yvatha ehu thol namaroth sereba,Vilya thilien drahgga tiryvatha eghol ylvin drahkala lirith va serebjon drahkela lyrenna tha drahkamethril.,the earth is a place where the wise person can attain peace and happiness through the practice of meditation,"Silent warriors emerge from the shadows, their power unrelenting, forging a legacy of darkness and tyranny."
