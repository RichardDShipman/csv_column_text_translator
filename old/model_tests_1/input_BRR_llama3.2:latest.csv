Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,I'm dead bruh fam 👻👺💀,OMG u no genes r like super long strings of DNA code bruh 💀🤯📝 that hold all the secrets 2 make some specific protein or RNA molecule 🧬💡 but they're also responsible 4 passin down traits 2 ur organelle fam 👪💔,"I'm dead, bro, what's good fam",Oh my god you know genes are like super long strings of DNA code bro that hold all the secrets to making some specific protein or RNA molecule but they're also responsible for passing down traits to your cellular family
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",🤯 Celleebuttface is totes dead 💀😂👻,"""Cellz r da OG blg blk blders 4 laif 🤯🔥💀 all livin thangz iz made outta cellez bro u got unicelz (1 cellz only lol) or multi celz (like plntz n aniuzlz 🤣😂) 🙄""",Celleebuttface is totally dead,"Cells are the OG building blocks of life, bro. All living things are made out of cells, but you've either got single-cells or multicellular ones like plants and animals."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","🔬💥DNA is like, totes made of twirly double helixy things that are all confused and stuff 🤯😂💀👽","DNA is like totally woooood, bruh, it's got these sick genetic instructions 🤯👀💁‍♀️ that are held together by some gnarly molecule, and it forms this wild double helix structure that's lowkey mindblowing 😲🔥😍",DNA is like totally made of twirly double helixy things that are all confused and stuff.,"DNA is like totally wood, bruh, it's got these sick genetic instructions that are held together by some gnarly molecule, and it forms this wild double helix structure that's lowkey mind-blowing"
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA is like, totally not a thing, bruh, it's more like r-N-A is just, you know, a random sequence of letters, but if we had to make something out of it, I guess it would sound like ""rona"" or ""roona"", but honestly, who knows what that even means, rn","RNA iz like DAH NUKLEEK AHID, bruh 💀🤯, itz single-stranded n stuff 😭😂, but its like SUPER IMPORTANT, no cap 👑💪, it helps translate teh genetic info from DNAA into PROTEINS 🧬🔩, and there iz types lik mRNA tRNA rRNA 🤝","RNA is not a thing, it's just a random sequence of letters, if we had to say it sounds like ronaway or roona but honestly who knows what that means","RNA is like DNA nucleic acid, bruh, it's single-stranded and stuff, but it's super important, no cap, it helps translate the genetic info from DNA into proteins, and there are types like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",w00t 🤪 wooo👀🐟💪,"Proteins r like wobbly jellyfish, bruh, dey got like a million different jobs 💀🤯, dey help cells hold it down, regulate life, make enzymes do their thang, and even catalyze reactions, fam 🚀, all while keeping the organism from totally imploding 😭","That's a fun one! Here's the translation:

""We're awesome, let's celebrate, with enthusiasm and pride, using strong language and lots of emotions!""","Proteins are like wobbly jellyfish, bro, they have a million different jobs, they help cells hold it together, regulate life, make enzymes do their thing, and even catalyze reactions, all while keeping the organism from totally falling apart."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",💣 Enzumeez 💥,"💀 enzymes r lil catalysts 4 bio chem reactions 🤯 they r mostly proteinz bruh 💨🔥 speeding up reactins like a pro, lowering activ8nury 2 let dem happen faster 4 better results lol 🧬💪",Explosion of energy,"enzymes are little catalysts for biochemical reactions they are mostly proteins, bro speed up reactions like a pro lower activation to let them happen faster for better results."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",💥 I'm dyin' from all da lipids bro 🤯😵👀,"Lipids r totes like, omigod 🤯 they're all hydrophobic 💦 or amphipathic 🌊 and stuff, include fats 🥗 oils ⛽️ phospholipids 🧬 and sterols 🏰, and dey help wif energy storage ⚡️ structural components of cell membranes 📦 and signaling molecules 🤫, and dey r essential 4 maintaining cell integrity and function 💪",I'm dying from all the lipids bro,Lipids are totally like omigod they're all hydrophobic or amphipathic and stuff include fats oils phospholipids and sterols and they help with energy storage structural components of cell membranes and signaling molecules and they r essential for maintaining cell integrity and function
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","Glycan is totes a wack sauce word that's all about da complex carbs and sugars in ur food, bruh! 😂🤣🍜","A glycan is like bruh a super complex carb bruh attached to proteins or lipids via magic ✨ glyco process bruh, which is lowkey important for cellular bruh life forms 💀️ like cell-cell comms 📱, immune systems 🔪️, and protein folding irl 👕","Glycan is a totally awesome word that's all about the complex carbs and sugars in your food, bro!",A glycan is like bro a super complex carb attached to proteins or lipids via a magic glyco process which is lowkey important for cellular life forms such as cell-cell communications protein folding and immune systems.
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",🔥 Chromosome is LITERALLY SO FREAKIN' DEADLY BRO💀👻😱,"I'm dyin' over here thinkin' a chromo is totes a wobbly, squiggly stringy thingy made outta DNA and protein sauce, bruh, it's like carryin' around the genetic info of an organism, lol, humans got 23 pairs of these chromos in their cells, omg",Chromosome is literally so freakin' deadly bro.,Im dyin over here thinkin a chromosome is totes a wobbly squiggly stringy thing made outta DNA and protein stuff it's like carrying around the genetic info of an organism lol humans got 23 pairs of these chromosomes in their cells
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","I'm dyin' over here, like, mitochondriiius is soooo whack 💀😂🤣","Mitochondria r organelles 4got 2 produce eneergy n teh forme of ATPe, lik, thys are teh 'powahouses' of teh cel, bruh, thys guyz h8 regulatin teh cel sikl & cel groth, tbh","I'm dying over here, like, mitochondria is so ridiculously bad","Mitochondria are organelles that forgot to produce energy in the form of ATP, like this is the 'powerhouse' of the cell, bro, guys hate regulating the cell cycle and cell growth, tbh."
