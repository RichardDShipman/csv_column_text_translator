Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cell,"The Minions from *Despicable Me* series call for a playful, nonsensical language to express their thoughts. They use words like ""playful,"" ""sensational,"" ""funny,"" and even ""witty"" when they want to make points. Their unique way of speaking adds a bit of humor to their conversations.",Cell,"The Minions from *Despicable Me* series call for a playful, nonsensical language to express their thoughts.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) je une molécule qui carries les instructions géniques utilisées pour l'apprentissage, la croissance et le fonctionnement des tout-elses vivants. Elle est composée de deux chaînes qui se coiffent autour de la première, en formant un double helix.",DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used for learning, growth, and functioning of all living things. It is composed of two chains that coalesce around the first, forming a double helix."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA (pronounced ""rnn-ah"")","RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded.
