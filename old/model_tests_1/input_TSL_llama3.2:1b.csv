Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Tavivon,"A genēk isā hleks tāʊk étāʊ tāʊk bēʊnē pōpīrāk wṛ́sā pōpērām, pōpēnēwọn eḳʊs tāʊk ʊsʏdʱaʊtēʊ kʰeʓēwēlʊ sʌmɛ́n.",Tavivon,"A geneticist studies the structure and function of living things, especially humans, to understand how they grow, reproduce, and die."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",ɛlɪl,"Tiew lahk thieh khrabk tse duat. Tiew lahk tiang htuak kyeu naa, nuk aing lau thieh pahw srook nih kaan.",electrical,They laugh at each other's foolishness and the one with a big mouth talks nonsense to the rest of them.
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",tso dna,DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) ni yin hteav na malaikaa ya nuktaa ambayo anawakilisha hali ya vivutio vyote vinavyowakilishwa kwenye kigeni katika uwanja wa afya ya kuifungia wa jumla wa makusudi yao. Inacholengwa na aina mbili za miguu ambazo zikiunda mhimili wa mwingine kati ya kila nyingine ili kutengeneza hali ya njia moja.,and,DNA is a molecule that carries the genetic information of an individual that describes all the features of life in a genetically determined environment within the field of medicine of general human health. It is condensed into two forms of DNA which form a third axis between each other to describe a single path.
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",Htaht,"Twi lek s' iya maan rnaa (ribonucleic acid) iya aatu siin naat, s'sa uuraan kai tukua oo dnaaa s'see kuo laa nuuri, iya kaayuuy s'tuunaa kuuu joo. Iya kaayooy t'iuu, t'nraa, aur r'nuaar.",how are you,"Twi lek s'iya maan rnaa (ribonucleic acid) iya aatu siin naat, s'sa uuraan kai tukua oo dnaaa s'see kuo laa nuuri, iya kaayuuy s'tuunaa kuuu joo Iya kaayooy t'iuu t'nraa aur r'nuaar."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteïns s'iniyá na' lóhngôk la' koe'n pahsok nahp e'na tsaengnê kwa' lóhngôk a' pahvah. Naahh lóhngôk e'na koo' thahtsah, e'na htaang na' kvaat e' s'iniyá. E' kha'thok kow nahp, na' thahtsah hti' na' saung kwa' e' tsaengnê pahvah, si'ma lóhngôk a' kha' n' thi'n sahpa' tsaengnê.","Protein is a complex organic compound essential for life and is composed of a long chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. It plays several critical roles in various biological processes, including protein synthesis, enzyme function, and cell signaling.","Proteins are being broken down in the body's own way. The process is called autolysis, where cells break apart and digest themselves. This natural process occurs throughout our entire lifespan."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzimew,"Enzyme eknoz arey kalthamok yath a kutha chekraechnay ota yinmay angkae anmay nay. Eya eko patao ee utha nway aekthoe a reaktion, aghay eht ee oteks eko ithay ekktay ee efaeth a na sretnay.",enzyme,"Enzymes are highly reactive molecules that can catalyze chemical reactions, which enables the conversion of substances into their desired forms."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipidi,"Līpids ews a twi'lek diphwa yiw sien lipidw tsāk ṭeip wot uweip tsawm nāj tōk yiw tsit ạlāpīt wot lipidw tsāk. Iway tsit iweip amsahphapīt sipwotip, siphāpīts, tōs alipidw tsāk, uwein tsimunaw htei tsanaw, naay tōk tuk yiw tsit ạlāpīt wot lipidw tsāk.",Lipid,Lipids are essential for the body's energy production and function. They serve as a source of fuel for cells and tissues throughout the body.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glykan,"A glykan ni anka karbohidrat au saccharid, satah osoh kohm kuay k'kot nih t'aay oun nuuh kaahs, a'tooh naal nuuh taahs ahna noh naay a'tooh. Glykans a'suuh paa kaiyuvon, ooah nih satah a'tooh u'da kuay k'kot nih t'aay oun nuuh kaahs.",Glycan is a type of carbohydrate,"A carbohydrate or sugar is an element of carbohydrates or sugars. Sweets are sweet and taste good to our ears now. Carbohydrates have many uses, ooah nih satah a'tooh u'da kuay k'kot nih t'aay oun nuuh kaahs."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Njul njaro,"A chromosome ekwadi tihkheh nda khraawtthawi tw'lek aak pahyaa s'awiin ttiawtaw tw'lek thihkheh nda khraawtthawi tw'lek. Tw'lek kaay s'awiin tw'lek, na' eela kuyaa s'awiin.",No sound,"A chromosome is highly repetitive and consists of a short repeat that is nearly identical to the DNA sequence in which it occurs. The repeat is repeated multiple times throughout the genome, and all organisms have one or more copies of this same short sequence."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondrialia,Mitochondriai kaetauwek dnaet eukaryawit ekciw otiaeu laa koei daatpua keu aei wiatheu naa dnaai wataa laaei ekuotai. Oonka leeeb dnaa daitnae kaetain laa koosae ekuotai dnaaoi dnaipanuwek naa reegoladaatne ekuotai.,mitochondrialia,"Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures in cells and a key component of all eukaryotes including humans, which use them to generate food and produce energy for their cell functions. The mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration where nutrients are broken down to produce ATP or glucose, that the cell can use to build proteins or synthesize other molecules, re-entering the cycle of metabolism."
