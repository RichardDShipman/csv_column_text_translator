Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Gene! (like a pirate calling their friend by name),"A gene is a long series of chemical symbols in a person's DNA that supplies the instructions needed to create a particular protein or RNA material. These genes serve as the fundamental building blocks of genetic inheritance, influencing various characteristics of an individual.",GÃ©nial ! (como si un pirata llamara al amigo),"A gene is a long series of chemical symbols in a person's DNA that supplies the instructions needed to create a particular protein or RNA material. These genes serve as the fundamental building blocks of genetic inheritance, influencing various characteristics of an individual."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Cells,"The cell is the core foundation of all life forms. All living beings consist of cells, which could be single-celled (organisms with a single cell) or multi-cellular (organisms including plants and animals).",Cells,"The cell is the core foundation of all life forms.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA! (with a wave of one arm),"DNA (deoxyribo[n]toxynucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms.

It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA, yah! Ya hava ya b'ayyos ah da ""Nyeen Hoo, Nieu Ha""! Yana aya, yana kuma ah naa ya aad yah, ma ay laa? Tey niaay yeh, yi caaya xadda ay kama an ayo. Xeeyi dhamo, ma yi ay laa ah, ma hanyaa ka haykai!","RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded.

Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Protein,"Proteins are big, complicated things made up of amino acids. They do all kinds of jobs inside living things, like making enzymes that speed up reactions (that's what ""enzymes"" mean) or building the stuff in cells that helps them work. And they also play a part in how our bodies act and think!",Protein,"Proteins are big, complicated things made up of amino acids.

Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Enzymes!,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that aid in accelerating chemical processes within living entities. They usually consist of proteins that decrease the activation energy of a reaction, making it easier for reactions to occur more rapidly and effectively.",Enzyms!,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that help accelerate chemical processes within living entities. They usually consist of proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, making it easier for reactions to occur more quickly and effectively."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Lipstick,"Lipids are a varied bunch of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They act like fuel storage, membrane building blocks, and signaling tools, essential for keeping cells healthy and performing their tasks.",Lipstick,"Lipids are a varied bunch of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They function as fuel storage, membrane building blocks, and signaling tools, crucial for maintaining cell health and performing their functions."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glucose,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation.

Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromoseme.,"A straiglegone is a taut, coiled piece of material made up of DNA and proteins. It holds the genetic information of organisms, and all humans have 46 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",Chromoseme.,"A straitline is a coiled piece of material composed of DNA and proteins. It holds the genetic information of organisms, and all humans have 46 pairs of chromosomes in their cells."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitokron,"Mitohumos er koinonia, toki oikokytonin, kai la mitoikonis eukaryotikon hagioi kataraxon. Kii ton 'plojontias' tou kai, mitohumos io a kai la pharomenoiko, on eis hagiosen higiotropoioi aikonou einai kale.",Mitoconerus,"Mitohumos er koinonia, toki oikokytonin, kai la mitoikonis eukaryotikon hagioi kataraxon.
