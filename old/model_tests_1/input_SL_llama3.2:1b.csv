Genetics have fundamental hereditary traits and respond to triple different parts of an organism.
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","Celotno izraz Cel

We are often given cells to perform certain functions which some cells are singular (single cell) or composed of multiple types of celestial bodies (stellar and celestial bodies).
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","DNA je molekularna snaga molekuli, ko jo sestavlja različite zvezde molekule (naturalska kemijska formula DNA je: C5H8O2N4)","DNA je molekula koja pomenija genetske izvedki uporabljeni v razvoj, razvoju in delovanju vsakog živih organizama. Na splošno sestoji v dvije strance, ki se zvezati around each other natočijo v dualni heliks.",DNA is the molecular strength of the molecule which is made up of different stars molecules (natural chemical formula for DNA is: C5H8O2N4),"DNA is the molecule that signifies genetic information used in development, growth and activity of all living organisms. In general it consists of two strands which are locked together in a banded double helix."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","RNA je ribozomski del, kjer se ribozomi deluje, pri čoli deli, ki so uporabljeni za različite kemikalne procese v ribozomih.","RNA (ribonukleinski kiselina) je molekula slika nalogne ali poizvedenjenjih DNA v obliki单链ov. RNA pliti zgodnjoščeno za prenov in prenov proteinov, s tipi kot mRNA, tRNA in rRNA.","RNA is a ribozyme activity where the ribozymes act, in any of the parts used for different chemical processes in ribozymes.","RNA is a nucleic acid molecule that looks like an analog or modified version of DNA in the form of single-stranded helices. It performs early gene expression by translating pre-existing genes into proteins with types such as mRNA, tRNA and rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",proteinski protein,"Proteini sojanke sijeze velike, zgodovinski molekule, za kojice se sestroznice izmerjavajo v kompleksni množici funkcij, kot tudi katere delajo rekcije (enzimi), priprostijo strukturu celic in urejanje biološkeh procesov.",proteinski protein,"Proteins are large, historical molecules which measure the connections in complex multi-functional molecules as well as do enzymes, function regularly (enzymes) and structure cells and regulate biological processes."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",enzim,"Enzimi soja živečni katalizatori, ki spreminjajo kemike v živih organizmih. Zvezati soja, ki so tudi enzimi, downrešijo aktivacijsko energijo reaktije, čemorja se pripreminja z veseljem bolje in efektivno.",enzyme,"Enzyme soya living catalyzators, which modify chemicals in living organisms. Redox soya enzymes reduce activity of reaction energy, making it better and more effective."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","Lipid je enobarikno razširjeni zdravo zvezdo v obliki triglicerida, kjer kozole vključajo lipide in njihovim odgovornost za zdravje.","Lipidi sošijo različne molecule, katere se lahko delijo na hydrofobne ali amfibaptive molecle, vključajo pašivo lipozme, tetezo in fosfolipside in sterole. Vejo potrebe za zdravo uporabo, strukturne sstrane celic, signaling vodiči in so načrt za zdravotno delnost celice.","Lipid are broadly distributed as neutral stars in the shape of triglycerides, where coles hold lipids and their responsibility for health.","Lipids store different molecules which can be split into hydrophobic or amphibiotic molecules, incorporating passive lipids, tethers and phospholipids as well as sterols. We observe the need for healthy use of these substances in cell structure, signaling pathways and a plan for the health function of the cell."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Glykan,"A glykan je karbohidrati ali saccharid, najšodjo vezo z sugar molekule, ki je lahko povezana z proteini ali lipidi v obliki vezanja glykosilazeja. Glykane sodelujejo v raznolikih biologskih procesih, vključevati cellularno komunikacijo, imunnoga responso in protein fijanje.",glycan,A carbohydrate is a sugar molecule that can bind to sugar molecules in the form of glycosidic bonds with proteins or lipids. Glycans participate in various biological processes including cell communication immunological response and protein fibrillation.
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",chromozom,"Chromozom je dlugočni, trakotni oblik, ki so zaneseni z genomi in proteini. To prispeva k genetski zvezdici njegove organiste, in prijatelječije človeku imajo 23 parov chromozoma v telesnih teločih.",chromosome,Chromosome is a long track-like structure containing genes and proteins. This contributes to the genetic architecture of its organs and its friendly humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondrije,"Mitokondrije so organselji ki soščajo v eukariotskih celici, zato so zaposljeni v produkciji energije v obliku ATP. Njih potrebno imega za 'zvezde snovirajo' celja, mitokondrije zvezdo oblikujejo tudi regolirano obročilo in oblikovalno razvojnega procesa.",mitochondria,"Mitochondria serve as organseljski organi, so zaposleni v produkciji energije v obliku ATP, njih potrebno imega za 'zvezde snovirajo' celja, mitokondrije zvezdo oblikujejo tudi regolirano obročilo in oblikovalno razvojnega procesa."
