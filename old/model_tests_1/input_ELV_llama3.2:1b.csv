Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,Nallon síne Nallon síne,"A dana éir nallon duir genetique, yngon ar dna idulynien nhageth a' mafre guinna, enyshon fëdelleth efa ylwyann efa llyrinni.",the lake is calm,"A gene is an inherited trait, originating from the DNA that contains the instructions for making the body's organs and tissues. It shapes our physical characteristics and influences our behavior and personality."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",Nallon síne lórien oelain eldar,"Nallon síne a eldain eldrës i lëonarë nìrëndë ollor

Ellëlenë eeldëntë a lëonarë, ullorë eiddaëntë",The One Ring's destruction,"The text seems to be written in an ancient language and doesn't have a clear translation. However, I can provide you with a possible translation:

In the land of leonards there are eternal eldrids
Eldalondë's creatures inhabit these lands
Eledraen dwell among the leonards, ullorin dwell nearby"
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","Noldorin Sindarin: dol dorin eldo
Quenya: dola dorindë lendo",Nenya dna dielba eldain dísai elet nasodra noel eva aeth elbereth re dori nallon. (deoxyribonucleic acid) en-dal i elthano eldo ra hela vili otnu re nielmo lel enelvina eldar,"Noldorin Sindarin: Dol dÃol Elde
Quenya: Dola Dorindi Lendo","The DNA molecule is a long chain of nucleotide bases that are linked together in a complex structure called base pairing. The sequence of these bases determines the genetic information contained within an organism, which is used for growth and development as well as to function properly."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","Nallon síne, RNA elbereth re, a elberet Noldorin","An elvish translation of the text would be:

Nallon síne (nāllōnsīné) éiras tin doo lothi, lēn tannôrin denna eilleno do ilvenîno
Érès ina nallon síne, éileno doo tholyn, aithi nallon síne, aethonê olleno doe illenêno","the ring of the Elves is made of Elbereth, the tree of the Noldor","An elvish translation of the text would be:

Érès ina nallon síne éileno doo tholyn aithi nallon síne aethonê olleno doe illenêno"
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",Orozilena aeluinil dia toro quenya olorien silmarillion eleni nallonil,"Proteini sunt largae,  complexe moleculi maie upa dna  aminoaci, haviendu  vaste eegarriy avariani dna  functioneihanaid hicih organima, includiuandu  anzahliandu enimathreiaezrhen, andregiuandua  biologicalae processsei.",Orozilena aeluinil dia toro quenya olorien silmarillion elenil nallonil,Proteins are large complex molecules made of amino acids having vast eggarries and functions to which these organsam include animals and plants.
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",Elvish translation: Aethoníma,"Enzymes drah eni tlent nart sultir uil reçeionu liyeng olvıng rísióner
Tarthas drava drah eil eldrá siltu rénai, iliv eri caéretna othor eldra réne",Aethoníma,"enzymes are highly active and sensitive to injury and illness
tartarus is the deepest layer of hell in greek mythology"
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",Nallon síne ladin Namarë lipið,"Lúthien lipidi dísariyendëi ollor apóshí a lissi, oila, phoslipidora e steròllaí lissi, ényáma tárihli íllantirëo álreinatë.",The place where it rains is called Mithlond,Luthien's flesh was made of the fruit of the tree that bears honey and milk and is eaten by bees and other animals.
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",Ailanthirë Glycān,A glycan glykan is a carbohydrate saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication immune response and protein folding.,Ailanthus alba,A glycan glycan is a carbohydrate saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes including cell-cell communication immune response and protein folding.
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","Nallon síne ""chromosome""","A kruta drahni elba nallon síne luthi doriath nallon
Elenyn doriath doriath aethoniel doriathan dyrnia doriath
Luthi nienna nallon aethoniel doriath doriathan dyrnia doriath
Nallon elba nallon luthi doriath doriath elenyn doriath",the word chromosome is translated to English as the word chromosome.,"The text appears to be a poem in Elvish. Here is the translation:

A little brown elf has found the forest of Nallon síne
A great beauty shines there for Elenyn and Doriath
In the presence of that beauty we are filled with love Doriathan dyrnia doriath
The little brown elf has found our home Luthi nienna nallon aethoniel doriath"
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Namarie okei mitochondriai,"Mitochondria sunt organella fondatee in celuri euokaryotike donte sunt responsabli de producerea energiei din formata ATP. Oameni-somurghi se numesc ""sosilele"" alaturi de mitocinzu, Mitocinuuni se desemnauaza ca siliu importanta a celului, Mitocinuuni pe de altă parte joacu o role in reglatura circulului celular si crearea celor crescatori.",goodbye life cells,Mitochondria are the foundational organelles of eukaryotic cells responsible for producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation which is an important energy source in humans and mice Mitocinzu (mitoquinone) plays a crucial role in regulating cellular circulation and cell growth.
