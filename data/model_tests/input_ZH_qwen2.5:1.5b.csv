Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是由DNA序列构成的，包含制造特定蛋白质或RNA分子的指令。基因是遗传的基本单位，并负责决定生物体的特征。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是构成和执行生命的基本结构和功能单位。所有生物体均由细胞组成，这些细胞可以单细胞（如单细胞生物）或多细胞（例如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",脱氧核糖核酸,DNA（脱氧核糖核酸）是能够将所有生物体生长、发育和功能中所需的遗传指令编码在分子中的大分子。它由两条形成双螺旋的链组成。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,RNA（核糖核酸）是一种类似于DNA的分子，但通常为单链。RNA在将从DNA中获得的遗传信息翻译成蛋白质方面起着关键作用，类型包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是由氨基酸组成的大型、复杂的分子。它们在生物体内执行广泛的功能，包括催化反应（酶），提供细胞结构，并调节生物学过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物催化剂，可加速活细胞中的化学反应。它们通常为蛋白质，降低反应的活化能，从而使其能够更快速、高效地进行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂类,脂质是一组包括脂肪、油、磷脂和胆固醇在内的疏水或两性分子。它们作为能量储存的载体，是细胞膜结构的重要组成部分，并且也是信号分子，对保持细胞完整性与功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖蛋白,糖胺聚糖是一种碳水化合物或糖类，通常是由糖分子组成的聚合物，可以通过糖基化附着在蛋白质或脂质上。糖胺参与了多种生物学过程，包括细胞之间的通信、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,一条染色体是由DNA和蛋白质组成的长长的、线状结构。它携带着生物的遗传信息，人类的细胞中有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",线粒体,线粒体是存在于真核细胞中的细胞器，负责以ATP的形式产生能量。通常被称为细胞的“动力工厂”，线粒体还参与调控细胞周期和细胞生长。
