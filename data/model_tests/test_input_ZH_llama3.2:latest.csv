Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,DNA序列中包含特定蛋白质或RNA分子的指令序列。基因是遗传的基本单位，决定生物体特征的关键组成部分。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命的基本结构和功能单元，所有生物都由细胞组成，可以是单细胞（如单胞菌）或多细胞（如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA（核酸）,DNA（脱氧核糖核酸）是所有生物体生长、发展和功能所依赖的遗传指令的分子。它由两个平行链 coilsAround形成双螺旋结构。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,RNA（核糖核酸）与DNA相似，但通常为单链。RNA在将遗传信息从DNA转换为蛋白质方面起着至关重要的作用，包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等类型。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是一类大型、复杂的分子，由氨基酸组成，能够催化反应（酶），为细胞提供结构，调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,"生化酶是生物催化剂，是生物体内化学反应的加速剂。它们通常是蛋白质，降低反应激活能，使其能够更加迅速和高效地进行。

Note: I translated ""enzymes"" to """" (shēng hū ài) which is the more common Chinese term for enzymes, and ""biological catalysts"" to """" (shēng wù cā yī zhì lǐ) which is a more literal translation. If you want to use the same word for both, you can translate it as """" (shēng hū ài zǔ zuò).

Also, please note that translating scientific texts requires some degree of compromise between accuracy and readability. The Chinese translation may not be identical to the original text in terms of precision or nuance, but it should convey the same general meaning."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂肪,脂质是一种多样化的氢解离性或双分子层的分子，包括脂肪、油类、磷脂和甾体等。它们在能量储存、细胞膜结构成分和信号传递中扮演着至关重要的角色，并是维持细胞完整性和功能所必需的。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖原,"糖原是一种碳水化合物或糖醇，通常是糖分子聚合体，可以与蛋白质或脂质在磷酸基团的形式下结合形成glycosylation。糖原参与多种生物过程，如细胞间沟通、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠。

Note: I used the Pinyin romanization system to translate the text into Chinese. If you want to use a different system, please let me know!"
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",原色体,一个染色体是一个由DNA和蛋白质组成的长、细的结构，负责传递生物体的遗传信息，人类细胞中有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",肽体,细胞质中含有核糖体、吞噬体和线粒体等器官。线粒体是具有自我分裂能力的细胞器，能够独立进行代谢，并将产生的能量转化为ATP形式供身体使用。
