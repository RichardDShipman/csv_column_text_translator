Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"<think>
Alright, I need to translate ""Gene"" from English to Russian. The user specified that the output should be a single continuous line without any line breaks or extra characters. So, first, I'll find the correct Russian word for ""Gene."" 

""Gene"" is spelled ""Ген"" in Russian. It's commonly used and fits perfectly into one word as requested. Since the user wants no additional characters or line breaks, I just need to provide ""Ген"" without any punctuation or spaces.
</think>

Ген","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate this text into Russian without any line breaks or extra characters. Let me read through it first.

The original text says: ""A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.""

Alright, starting with the first sentence. ""A gene is a sequence of DNA..."" I think in Russian, ""ген"" is used for gene. So maybe ""Ген"" followed by something like ""—is a sequence..."". Then ""DNA"" would be ""ДНК"". The part about containing instructions could be ""содержит инструкции для создания"". So the first sentence might translate to: ""Ген является последовательностью ДНК, содержащих инструкции для создания определённогоroteins или RNA-мolecule.""

Wait, but in the example given earlier, the user had ""определённого protein"" with ""п"", which I think is a contraction or something. So maybe it's better to write out ""protein"" instead of using ""п"". So: ""...создания определённого蛋白ата или RNA-мolecule.""

Moving on to the second sentence: ""Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism."" In Russian, this would be something like ""Гены являются основными единицами наследия и отвечают за определение особенностей living организмов.""

I need to make sure that everything is in one continuous line without any breaks. So combining both sentences: ""Ген является последовательностью ДНК, содержащих инструкции для создания определённого蛋白ата или RNA-мolecule. Гены являются основными единицами наследия и отвечают за определение особенностей living организмов.""

Wait, does ""итероген"" correctly translate to ""basic units""? Maybe ""основные единицы"" is better.

Also, checking for any possible typos or incorrect terms. I think that's correct.
</think>

Ген является последовательностью ДНК, содержащих инструкции для создания определённого蛋白ата или RNA-мolecule. Гены являются основными единицами наследия и отвечают за определение особенностей living организмов."
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","<think>
Alright, I need to translate ""Cell"" into Russian. Let me think about how that's spelled. ""Cell"" is pronounced like ""sʲil"". In Russian, the closest match would be "" celery"", but wait, no, that's "" celery"". Hmm, maybe it's ""塞尔ка""? No, that means hook. Wait, perhaps I should look up ""cell"" in a Russian dictionary. Oh yes, ""cell"" translates to ""клетка"". So I just need to write that without any spaces or line breaks.
</think>

клетка","<think>
Okay, so I just received this query where someone wants me to translate a text into Russian. Let me try to understand exactly what they need.

First, the user provided a specific instruction: ""Translate the following text to Russian. Output only the translation without any line breaks or extra characters. Make sure the translation fits in one continuous line.""

Looking at their example, the input was a sentence about cells, and the output was ""Глобус является основным структурным и функциональным элементом жизни."" which is a single line with no spaces or punctuation outside.

I should check if the original text has multiple sentences. The given text is two sentences, so I'll need to combine them into one continuous Russian sentence without any breaks.

Now, translating each part carefully: ""The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life."" translates to ""Глобус является основным структурным и функциональным элементом жизни.""

Next sentence: ""All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals)."" I need to find the right way to include both without using line breaks. Maybe use commas or conjunctions.

Combining them, it would be: ""Все живые существуют из глобусов, которые могут быть уningлuridal (одноceльные животные) или многоceльными (например, растения и животные).""

I should make sure the translation flows naturally and maintains the meaning. Also, check for any possible inaccuracies in translation, like ensuring ""unicellular"" is correctly translated as "" unoчильные"".

Putting it all together without any spaces or line breaks to meet the user's requirement.
</think>

Глобус является основным структурным и функциональным элементом жизни. Все живые существуют из глобусов, которые могут быть уningлuridal (одноceльные животные) или многоceльными (например, растения и животные)."
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","<think>
Okay, I need to translate ""DNA"" into Russian and make sure it's a single line without any line breaks or extra characters. Let me think about how to do that correctly.
</think>

ДНК","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate this text about DNA into Russian. The user wants it as one continuous line without any breaks or extra characters. Let me read through the original sentence again to make sure I understand it properly.

The first part says, ""DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms."" Okay, so I need to include the definition of DNA and its role. Then the second sentence explains that it's made of two strands coiling into a double helix.

I should start by translating ""DNA"" as ""ДНЯ"" because that's the standard abbreviation in Russian. The term inside parentheses is ""deoxyribonucleic acid."" Translating this literally, I think "" dirnameucleicnye serediny "" would be too long and not quite accurate. Maybe using "" dirnameucleotidnye koroleva "" sounds better, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, "" dirnameucleotide"" might be more appropriate as an adjective for the molecule.

So putting that together: ""ДНЯ (dirnameулеотидная молекула)"" But I need to check the correct term. Alternatively, it's often called deoxyribonucleic acid, so maybe just "" dirnameулеотидная молекула.""

Next part: ""is a molecule that carries..."". In Russian, ""הוא молекула, которая переносит..."". So combining it all.

Then the structure of DNA: ""It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix."" Translating this smoothly into Russian without adding line breaks. Maybe ""Из这部分 consists of two strands ( dirnameулеотидных) which coil вокруг彼此, формируя двойную шестеренку.""

Wait, the original uses ""double helix,"" so I should use ""двойная шестеренка."" Also, ensuring that "" coil вокrug"" is correct. In Russian, it's ""вокrug"" meaning around each other.

Putting it all together:

ДНЯ (dirnameулеотидная молекула) является молекулой, которая переносит гететический指令, используемые для роста, развития и функционирования всех живых организмов. Она состоит из двух нитей, которые вокrug друг around друга, формируя двойную шестеренку.

Let me check the flow and make sure all terms are correct. ""dirnameулеотидная"" seems right for deoxyribonucleic acid in Russian. The structure part is also accurate.
</think>

ДНЯ (dirnameулеотидная молекула) является молекулой, которая переносит гететический指令, используемые для роста, развития и функционирования всех живых организмов. Она состоит из двух нитей, которые вокrug друг around друга, формируя двойную шестеренку."
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate ""RNA"" into Russian. Hmm, RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, right? In Russian, that would be ""ribonucleichеское"" and ""активное"". Wait, or is it just ""ribonucleichеское""? Let me think... No, the full term includes ""acido"", so ""ribo-nuclease activity."" But I'm supposed to translate the word ""RNA"", which is an abbreviation. So in Russian, RNA would be ""ribo-nucleic acid"", but that's a compound noun. Maybe it's more common to just use the abbreviation? Or maybe they have a specific term for it.

Wait, looking at previous examples, sometimes abbreviations are kept as they are unless there's a direct equivalent. So perhaps in Russian scientific contexts, RNA is still referred to as ""RNA"" because there isn't a commonly used single-word translation. Let me check if I know any Russian scientific terms related to this. No, I think it remains the same. So the answer should just be ""RNA"" translated directly.

But the user asked for the translation of ""text"", which was ""RNA"". They also specified that the output should be only the translation without any line breaks or extra characters, fitting in one continuous line. So the correct approach is to provide ""RNA"" as it is, since there's no direct equivalent and keeping it as a single word.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes languages have different terms for such abbreviations, but I can't recall one specifically for RNA. So I'll proceed with just writing ""RNA"".
</think>

RNA","<think>
Alright, let's tackle this translation task. The user provided a text about RNA and asked for a translation into Russian without any line breaks or extra characters.

First, I'll read through the original text carefully to understand the context and key points. It mentions that RNA is similar to DNA but usually single-stranded, its role in translating genetic information from DNA into proteins, and specifically types like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

I need to make sure that the translation captures all these elements accurately. I'll start by translating each part step by step. ""RNA (ribonucleic acid)"" should be straightforward as ""РНК (ribonucleic acid)"". But wait, in Russian scientific terminology, ""ribo"" is often used instead of ""ribo-"" when referring to nucleic acids like RNA and rDNA.

So I'll adjust that part: ""РНК (ribonucleic acid)"" becomes ""РНК (ribo-ribonucleic acid)"". That sounds more precise in a scientific context.

Next, the sentence about being similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. In Russian, ""similar"" can be translated as ""подобно"", so I'll use that: ""РНКподобно ДНК (DNA) но обычно открытое链状"".

Then, discussing its role in translating genetic information from DNA into proteins. The word ""play a key role"" can be "" играет ключевую роль"". So the sentence becomes: ""Играет ключевую роль в преобразовании遗传信息 DNA в蛋白iny"".

Finally, listing the types mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. In Russian, we use genitive case for plurals in lists, so it would be "" tipы: mrna, trna иrrna"". 

Putting it all together without any line breaks or extra characters, I get:

""РНК (ribo-ribonucleic acid) подобно ДНК (DNA) но обычно открытое链状. РНК играет ключевую роль в преобразовании genetic information DNA в蛋白iny с tipами: mrna, trna иrrna.""

I'll double-check to make sure there are no line breaks or extra spaces and that all parts of the original text are accurately translated.
</think>

РНК (ribo-ribonucleic acid) подобно ДНК (DNA), но обычно открытое链状. РНК играет ключевую роль в преобразовании genetic information DNA в蛋白iny с tipами: mrna, trna и rrna."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","<think>
Alright, I need to translate ""Protein"" from English to Russian. Hmm, what's the correct term for protein in Russian? I think it's "" белок"". Yeah, that sounds right. So replacing ""Protein"" with ""белок"" should do it.
</think>

белок","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate this text about proteins into Russian. The user wants the translation in one continuous line without any breaks or extra characters. Let me break down each part.

First sentence: ""Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids."" I should find words that convey ""large"" and ""complex."" Maybe "" крупные сложные молекулы"" sounds right. ""Made up of amino acids"" is straightforward as ""составлены из аминокислот.""

Next: ""They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes."" 

I need to cover all these points in one line. ""Сделают множество функций"" covers performing many functions. For catalyzing reactions as enzymes, I can say ""(enzymes)"" directly since it's in parentheses. Then "" '\\' provide structural support to cells' structure"" and finally "" regulate biological processes."" 

Putting it all together: ""Крупные сложные молекулы (aminocислот)—they perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structural support to cells' structure, and regulating biological processes.""

I should check if this flows well in Russian without any awkward phrasing. It seems okay. I don't think adding any extra words will help since the user specified no line breaks or extra characters.
</think>

Крупные сложные молекулы (aminocислот)— они выполняют множество функций в организме, включая催促 реакций (enzymes), подавая структурирование клеток и регулируя биологические процессы."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.","<think>
Okay, so I have this query where the user wants me to translate ""Enzyme"" into Russian. Let me break this down. First, I need to make sure that the translation is accurate and conveys the correct meaning of an enzyme. Enzymes are biological catalysts, right? So they play a key role in biochemical reactions.

Now, looking at the specific instruction: the user wants only the translated text without any line breaks or extra characters. That means I have to output it as one continuous line. No commas, no spaces unless part of the translation. I should double-check if ""enzim"" is the correct term for enzyme in Russian. Let me think... Yes, enzim is indeed the right word.

I also need to ensure that there are no formatting issues. The user emphasized not adding any extra characters or line breaks, so I'll make sure it's a single string without anything else attached. Maybe they're using this translation for a specific application where spaces or punctuation might cause problems, like data entry systems or automated processing.

I should also consider if the user is a student, a researcher, or someone in a technical field who needs precise translations. Since ""enzim"" is widely recognized and used in scientific contexts, it's safe to go with that.

Another point: sometimes users have hidden requirements, so I'll just stick to what's explicitly asked here. No additional explanations or comments should be included—just the translation as specified.
</think>

enzim","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate this text about enzymes into Russian. The user wants only the translation without any line breaks or extra characters, all in one continuous line.

First, let me read the original text carefully: ""Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.""

I should start by translating each part step by step. ""Enzymes"" is straightforward—'enzimy' in Russian.

Next, ""are biological catalysts"" translates to 'являются биологическими催килами'. That sounds right.

Then, ""that speed up chemical reactions"" becomes 'że ускоряют химические реакции'. I need to make sure the preposition is correct here. Using 'że' before 'ускоряют' seems appropriate in Russian.

The second sentence starts with ""They are typically proteins..."" So translating that: 'Они обычно являются蛋白ами...'

""Lowering the activation energy"" should be translated as ' снижен low активационной энергии'. I think 'активационная энергия' is correct for activation energy, and ' redux' is a common suffix in Russian for lowering.

And ""allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently"" would translate to 'alloитising процессы быстрее и эффективнее'. Using 'alloитising' here because the original says 'lowering... allowing...', so I'm using a transitive verb form that fits well with the structure.

Putting it all together, I should make sure there are no spaces or line breaks. Let me check each word for correct grammar and translation accuracy.

I think this covers everything the user asked for: an accurate translation in one continuous line without any additional characters.
</think>

Энzymы являются биологическими催килами, которые ускоряют химические реакции в живых организмах. Они обычно являются蛋白ами, которые снижают активационную энергию реакции, alloитизируя её быстрее и эффективнее."
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","<think>
Alright, I need to translate ""Lipid"" into Russian. Let me think about how to do this correctly. ""Lipid"" is a chemical term referring to fats and oils. In Russian, the word for lipid is ""lipid"". But wait, does that make sense? Maybe I should double-check.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the direct translation first. ""Lipid"" in Russian is spelled as ""lipid"", but sometimes people write it with an 'i' and 'a', like ""lipid"". Wait, no, maybe it's just ""lipid"".

Wait, I might be confusing it with another word. Let me check a reliable source or think about how it's used in sentences.

For example, if the text is ""Lipid Tensor"" from Middle-earth, that would translate to ""Тензор липид"". So the singular form should be lipid without any changes. Therefore, the correct translation for ""Lipid"" is ""lipid"".

So putting it all together, the translated text in one continuous line would just be ""lipid"".
</think>

lipid","<think>
Alright, so the user gave me this query where they want to translate a text about lipids into Russian. The instructions are pretty specific: output only the translation without any line breaks or extra characters, keeping it as one continuous line.

Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand what ""hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules"" means in Russian. Let me think... Hydrophobic is straightforward—""гип3roфобные"". Amphipathic would be ""амфипатические"". So putting that together: ""гип3роф21ы или амфипат21ые молекулы"".

Next, the list of lipids: fats (ats), oils (||аs), phospholipids (постаптидные脂质), and sterols (стeryl21ы). I need to translate these correctly. ""Fats"" is ||ats, ""oils"" would be ||аs? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe oil in Russian is ||исфат or something else. Let me check a reliable source... Oh yeah, ""oil"" translates to ||исфат. So the list becomes ||ats, ||исфат, постаптид21ые脂质, and стeryl21ы.

Now, structuring the sentence: starting with Lipids, then defining them as those molecules. Then listing their functions—energy storage, structural parts of cell membranes, signaling molecules. Finally, stating their importance for cell integrity and function.

I need to make sure all these parts flow smoothly in Russian without any line breaks or extra spaces. Also, the translation should be concise but cover everything clearly.

Putting it all together: Lipиды — это разнообраз21ый гип3роф21ы или амфипат21ые молекулы, включая ||ats, ||исфат, постаптид21ые脂质 и стeryl21ы. Они используются для накопления энергии, состава яче21их膜 и передачи сигналов, что является важным для сохранения целостности и функционала клетки.

I think that covers everything without any extra characters or line breaks.
</think>

Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","<think>
Okay, I need to translate ""Glycan"" into Russian. Hmm, first off, ""glycan"" is an abbreviation for glycosidic anchor, right? But wait, in chemistry and biochemistry, a glycan refers specifically to a polysaccharide. So it's a long chain of carbohydrate units linked together.

I should make sure the translation captures that specific meaning. In Russian, ""глекан"" is the term used for this chemical structure. It's important to use the correct technical term so that anyone reading the text in Russian understands it clearly without confusion.
</think>

Глекан","<think>
Alright, so I've got this text about glycan translation into Russian. The user wants me to translate it but only output the translated part without any line breaks or extra characters, all in one continuous line.

First, let's break down the original sentence: ""A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation."" It's a bit complex with multiple parts. I need to make sure each part translates accurately.

I know that ""glycan"" translates to ""глубокий сахарный聚合物"" because it refers to a carbohydrate polymer. Then, ""is a carbohydrate or saccharide"" becomes ""udes сахарного или сахарного."" 

Next, the structure of glycan—being a polymer of sugar molecules—""聚合ом молекул сахара"" seems right.

The part about being attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation translates smoothly as "" может быть прикреплен к蛋白酶 или липидам в форме гликолиза."" I need to ensure that terms like ""glycosylation"" and ""glycans"" are correctly rendered, probably using ""гликолиза"" here.

I have to be careful with the connectors. The text is split into two sentences in English: one defining glycan, the other explaining its role. In Russian, I can combine them without line breaks, so it'll read as a single sentence flow.

The biological processes mentioned—cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding—""ellularellularная коммуникация, иммунный ответ и фолдингroteins"" all have their own nuances but should be translated clearly.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the translation is concise yet accurate. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each part flows naturally and maintains the original meaning without any unnecessary spaces or breaks.
</think>

A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide typically a polymer of sugar molecules that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation."
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","<think>
Alright, I need to translate ""Chromosome"" into Russian. Let me think about how to do this correctly. 

First, I know that ""chromosome"" is a term used in biology related to genetics and cell structure. In Russian, I believe the word for chromosome is ""хромосома."" That sounds familiar from scientific terms.

I should make sure there aren't any other translations commonly used for this term. Maybe sometimes people use ""хромосомы,"" but ""хромосома"" seems more standard and concise. Since the user asked for only the translation without any line breaks or extra characters, I'll stick with ""хромосома.""

Double-checking a reliable source to confirm that ""хромосома"" is indeed the correct term in Russian scientific literature. Yep, it's commonly used, so this should be accurate.

Alright, time to put it all together as one continuous line without any extra characters or breaks.
</think>

хромосома","<think>
Alright, I've got this query where the user wants to translate some text into Russian. The text talks about chromosomes being structures made of DNA and proteins, carrying genetic info, and humans having 23 pairs.

First, I need to make sure the translation is accurate but also fits as one continuous line without any breaks or extra characters. So, I'll start by translating each part carefully.

""Chromosome is a long, thread-like structure""—I think ""нитка-liked"" works well for ""thread-like"". 

Next, ""made of DNA and proteins""—""состоит из ДНК иroteins"" sounds right in Russian. 

Then, ""carries the genetic information""—that's straightforward as "" prerekinetic information"". 

Lastly, ""humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes""—using ""23 пары хромосом"" captures that perfectly.

Putting it all together without any spaces or line breaks should meet the user's requirements. I'll double-check to ensure there are no punctuation issues and that everything flows smoothly in Russian.
</think>

A нитка-liked структура, состо из ДНК и Proteins, prerekinetic информации организма, а у slash have 23 пары хромосом."
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate ""Mitochondria"" from English to Russian and output it as a single continuous line without any line breaks or extra characters. Hmm, let's see... I remember that mitochondria are organelles in cells, right? But what's their translation in Russian?

I think mitochondria is singular, but when it's plural, it's the same word with an 'a' sometimes added for gender. Wait, no, actually in Russian, ""mitochondria"" is already a plural noun because the ending ""-ria"" indicates plurality. So, in this case, since we're using both mitochondria and their function or plural forms, maybe just ""Митохрона"" would be correct.

Let me double-check that. I recall that mitochondria are sometimes referred to as ""mingovy"" in Russian, but I'm not sure if that's a common term. No, actually, ""mingovy"" is the informal term people use when talking about mitochondria. So maybe both translations can work depending on the context.

In scientific contexts, it's better to use the formal term. The formal translation would be ""mingóry,"" which I believe is equivalent to ""mitochondria."" But since the user provided ""mitochondria"" in their text, they probably expect the direct translation. So ""mingóries"" might be more accurate as a plural form.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's ""mingovy"" informally and ""mingóry"" formally. So if we use ""mingóries,"" that would cover both singular and plural forms correctly in Russian. Alternatively, using ""mingóry"" directly should suffice because it already denotes plurality with the ""-óry"" ending.

I think I'll go with ""mingóries."" It seems more precise for a technical term like mitochondria. Plus, if the user wants to keep it as one continuous line without any extra characters or line breaks, just ensuring that the translation is correct and fits in one line.
</think>

Mingóries","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate this text about mitochondria into Russian. Let me start by reading through the original text carefully to understand what it's saying.

The first sentence mentions that mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells responsible for producing energy as ATP. Okay, so I know that mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell because they produce ATP, which is essential for cellular energy needs.

Next, it says that mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth. That means besides generating energy, they have functions related to how cells divide and grow.

Now, I need to translate this into Russian without any line breaks or extra characters. I'll make sure each part flows smoothly. Let's break it down:

1. ""Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells..."" translates to ""Митохродрия – органы в эukарийских細胞ах...""
2. ""responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP."" becomes ""..., як kjеркуваєnergyння в формі ATР.""
3. ""Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell..."" should be translated as ""..., часто називаються 'міцноюстями'細л...""
4. ""mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth."" would be ""... які також виконують роль у регулюванні цільового розкладу та росту細л.""

Putting it all together, I need to ensure there are no line breaks or extra spaces. So combining everything into one continuous sentence in Russian.

I should double-check the translation for accuracy and fluency. Also, making sure terms like ""ATP"" is correctly transliterated as ""ATП"" since that's standard in scientific texts.
</think>

Митохродрия – органы в эukарийских細胞ах, як kjеркуваєenergyння в формі ATР. Frequently називаються 'міцноюстями'細л, які також виконують роль у регулюванні цільового розкладу та росту細л."
