Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是DNA序列，其中包含制造特定蛋白质或RNA分子的指令。基因是遗传的基本单位，负责决定个体的特质。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命体的基本结构和功能单位。所有生物都是由细胞组成的，这些细胞可以是单个（如单细胞生物）或复数（如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,DNA 是一种携带生长、发育和功能的全部活细胞遗传指令的分子。它由两股螺旋围绕在一起形成双螺旋。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是大量、复杂的分子，由氨基酸组成。它们在生物体内发挥广泛的功能，包括催化反应（酶）、提供细胞结构和调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物催化剂，用于活细胞中的化学反应。通常情况下，它们是最小化的蛋白质，并且能降低一个化学反应的激活能，从而使该反应更容易进行和更高效地运行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂肪,脂类是一类包括脂肪、油和磷脂、和甾体化合物在内的多样的非极性或中等疏水分子。它们储能、细胞膜的结构组成部分，以及信号分子，对维持细胞完整性及功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖链,糖链是基于蛋白质或脂肪的糖类或半糖化合物，通常以糖分子的形式聚合。糖基团在多种生物过程中扮演重要角色，包括细胞之间通讯、免疫应答和蛋白质折叠。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,一个染色体是由DNA和蛋白质组成的长、线状结构。它携带了个体的遗传信息，并且人类在细胞中有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",线粒体,"线粒体在真核细胞中是负责产生ATP的能量生产器。通常称为细胞的""动力之源""，线粒体还参与调控细胞周期和细胞增殖。"
