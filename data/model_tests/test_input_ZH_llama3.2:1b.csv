Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,一条遗传物质是一段DNA序列，含有编码特定蛋白质或核糖体单磷酸基因的指令。遗传物质是生物体基本元件，是决定个体特征的基础。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命的基本结构和功能单位 allLiving องค體都是由細胞組成可以是單一細胞（單形細胞）或多形細胞（如植物和動物）
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA 基因组为双螺旋结构,DNA 是基因组的遗传物质，携带所有生命体都发育和功能所需的遗传指令。它由两条螺旋结构组成，一条从起始到结束，另一条从端点到端点，螺旋结构与其上下左右互换而形成双螺旋。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",核糖核酸,RNA是一种类似DNA的分子，它通常是单链的。RNA在翻译遗传信息从DNA转化为蛋白质中起着关键作用，具有不同类型如mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,proteines yongu guopai de amoni akus biao le ma gao lei li yu yizhi jian ding zui xiang ren zi zhi yao yuan sheng fen zhi yao
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物化学中的一种催化剂，它通过降低反应的能量活性来促进化学反应。它们通常是蛋白质，降低反应的能量活性，导致该反应更快地进行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂肪,脂质是一组水溶性或甘油性分子，包括脂肪、胆汁、磷脂和醣类。它们作为能量储存、细胞膜结构成分以及信号分子的重要部分，具有维持细胞功能的必要性。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖苷,A carbohydrate或saccharide通常是糖分子的一种，通常是由糖分子组成的聚合物，可能与蛋白质或脂肪在形式上被附着到。  glycans经常参与生物学过程中的细胞间 communication、免疫反应以及蛋白质折叠等。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,一条染色体是由DNA和蛋白质组成的长细丝，携带着个体的遗传信息。人体细胞内有三十二对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",细胞核的中间环是核糖体的部分,Mitochondria是由核糖体细胞产生能量的形式为ATP。这些细胞也扮演着调节细胞周期和生长的角色。
