Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是指由DNA序列组成的含有特定蛋白质或RNA分子指令的序列。基因是遗传的基础，决定生物体的性状。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命的基础结构和功能单位。所有生物都是由细胞组成的，可以单个细胞（如单细胞生物）或多细胞（例如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,"DNA (脱氧核糖核酸), 一种用于所有生物生长、发育和功能的遗传指令携带者。它由两条螺旋状的线组成，通过相互缠绕形成双螺旋结构。"
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA,RNA (ribonucleic acid) 是一个与DNA类似但通常单链的分子。RNA在将遗传信息从DNA转化为蛋白质的过程中扮演关键角色，包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等类型。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是高度复杂的分子，由氨基酸组成。它们在生物体内执行广泛的功能，包括催化反应（酶）；通过提供细胞结构；和调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是活细胞中的生物催化剂，能加速生物体内的化学反应。它们通常是蛋白质，能够降低反应的激活能量，使其更快速、更有效地进行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂质,脂质是一类包含脂肪、油和磷脂、以及甾醇的多态性或半介体分子。它们是能量存储、细胞膜结构组成中的基本成分，同时也是信号分子，并对维持细胞完整性及功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖链,糖基是常见的糖或寡糖的聚合物，通常由糖分子组成，并能与蛋白质或脂质结合形成糖化。糖基在生物过程中的作用包括细胞-细胞通讯、免疫应答和蛋白折叠。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,一个染色体是一个由DNA和蛋白质组成的长线状结构。它承载着个体的遗传信息，人类在细胞中拥有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",Mitochondria 是中文中的拼音缩写，通常译为“线粒体”。如果你需要更详细的翻译，请告诉我。,线粒体是真核细胞中负责产生ATP的形式的 organelle。通常被称为细胞之'动力站'，线粒体也参与调节细胞周期和细胞生长。
