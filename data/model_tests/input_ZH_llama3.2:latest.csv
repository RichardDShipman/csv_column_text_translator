Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是DNA序列中编码特定蛋白质或RNA分子的指令。基因是遗传的基本单位，负责决定生物体的特征。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",单细胞,细胞是生命的基本结构和功能单位，所有生物体都是由细胞构成的，可以是单细胞或多细胞，如植物和动物。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",DNA,DNA（脱氧核糖核酸）是所有生生物体的基因指令传递分子，含有两个单链环绕形成双螺旋结构
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",RNA（核糖核酸）,RNA（核酸）是一种与DNA相似的单链分子，RNA在翻译遗传信息从DNA到蛋白质方面发挥着关键作用，包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等类型。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是一种大型、复杂的分子，由氨基酸组成。它们在生物体中执行了一个广泛的功能，包括催化反应（酶）、提供细胞结构以及调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物化学催化剂，它们使得生物体内化学反应发生更快，更高效。它们通常为蛋白质，并降低反应激活能，使反应能够更加快速、效率更高
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂肪,脂质是一种具有水疏性或双分子层的多样化分子群体，包括脂肪、油类、磷脂和甾醇。它们在能量储存、细胞膜结构成分、信号分子中扮演着重要角色，并为维持细胞完整性和功能必不可少。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖类,糖是碳水化合物或糖苷，通常是糖分子的聚合体，可以附着到蛋白质或脂质上，通过糖基化。糖体参与了细胞之间的通信、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠等多种生物过程。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,chromosome是一条长的、丝状的DNA和蛋白质结构，负责传递遗传信息，是人体细胞中的23对染色体
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",嗜碱性粒体,-organelles found in eukaryotic cells responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP-often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of the cell-regulating the cell cycle and cell growth-
