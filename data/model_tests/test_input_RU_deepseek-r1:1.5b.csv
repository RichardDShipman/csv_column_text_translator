Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,"<think>
Okay, so I need to translate ""Gene"" into Russian and make it fit just as a single line with no line breaks or extra stuff. Let me think about what ""Gene"" means here. In biology, a gene is a segment of DNA that encodes a protein. So in this context, the translation should probably be something like ""гeneктичнe"" which means 'genetic' since genes are part of the genetic material.

Wait, no, maybe it's more specific. I recall that ""genus"" and ""species"" have different endings too. But ""Gene"" is just a gene, so maybe I can go with ""гeneктичнe."" It sounds natural in Russian.

Let me double-check if there are other possibilities. Could it be "" genu"" or ""gen""? No, those don't seem right. Genu would mean something else entirely. So yeah, ""гeneктичне"" is the correct term here.
</think>

_geneктичне","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate this English text into Russian. Let me read through it carefully.

""A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.""

Hmm, first word ""A gene"" becomes ""А genomic."" I know that's correct because it starts with a vowel sound and often uses ""а"" before nouns in Russian.

Next part: ""contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule."" So, ""мaksимумных амide让它ов или макronомных ионокисидированных"" That seems right because it's talking about proteins (amides) and RNA (ionokisidines). I think that works.

Then, ""Genes are the basic units of heredity."" That should be ""А genomic — это основные элементы редкини и содержат все важные особенности"" To make it flow better in Russian. It's using scientific terms correctly.

Lastly: ""are responsible for determining the traits of an organism."" So, ""представляют влияние на характерыorganismо"" I believe this is correct because it clearly states that genes determine the traits of organisms.

Putting it all together, I want to make sure there are no line breaks or extra characters. Let me check each sentence for proper structure in Russian. It seems each part flows naturally into the next without needing line breaks. Everything looks consistent and accurate.
</think>

А genomic — это основные элементы редкини и содержат все важные особенности  
Аmino acids are the basic elements of rDNA and contain all the important features  
All these genes determine the traits of an organism"
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).","<think>
Okay, I need to translate ""Cell"" into Russian. Let me think about what ""cell"" means in English and then find the right word for its Russian equivalent.

In English, ""Cell"" refers to a small structure in plants or animals that stores substances like nutrients and water. So, it's like a mini-life cycle within an organism.

Now, I should check some common terms in Russian related to cells. ""Клетка"" is short for cell, which seems appropriate here because it literally translates to ""cell.""

Let me make sure there are no other possible words. Sometimes technical terms can have alternative transliterations or different meanings, but in this case, ""клетка"" directly conveys the meaning of a cell.

I should also consider if there's a more formal Russian term that might be used in scientific contexts. However, ""клетка"" is standard and commonly understood.

To ensure accuracy, I'll double-check. Yes, cell translates to клетка in Russian without any issues. It's concise and fits perfectly into one line as the user requested.
</think>

клетка","<think>
Okay, so I have this text that says: ""The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals)."" And I need to translate it into Russian. Hmm.

First, let me break down what each part means. ""The cell is the fundamental..."" So that's about how important a cell is in living things. Then ""structural and functional unit"" — meaning cells have both physical structure and what they do in their environment.

Next, ""living organisms"" are made up of cells. That makes sense because all life is composed of cells. The plural form here: ""cells."" Now, ""which can be unicellular"" — that's singular, so just one cell. ""Such as plants and animals"" – which includes both plants (unicellular?) No, wait, plants are generally multicellular but some like certain bacteria might be single. And animals could also be either.

So the structure in Russian should convey something like: Each living organism is built from cells, which can be single or multiple. Now, how to translate this? Let me think about each part step by step.

""Each living organism is built from cells."" In Russian, ""Каждый Living organism"" – ""is built from"" could be ""из build""). Wait, maybe ""состоит из."" That's correct: ""состоит из.""

""The fundamental..."" So perhaps ""Основной"" because it's the primary or essential part. So combining these two, I think ""Основная часть living organism — cell.""

Then ""cells can be unicellular."" In Russian, ""unicellular"" is ""одинuclear."" But since we don't know if it's always one, maybe just plural form? Wait, no: the text says ""which can be unicellular,"" so in general. So I think it should still use "" unbekannt""?

Wait, but how to translate ""can be"" – that might be ""а, можно?"" Or maybe ""могут быть""? Hmm.

Also, ""such as plants and animals."" Translating that, perhaps ""на руки"", but not sure. Maybe ""на страницах"" or ""в разделах"". Alternatively, ""например"" which can introduce examples.

Putting it all together: The basic unit is cell (uniquely built?) — no, the first part says everything's made of cells, each organism has them, whether single or multiple.

So putting it all together:

Каждый Living organism — основная часть living organism — cell. Cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache..cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbрализным (multicellular). Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organismы, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биологичными (single cells), но они также многофimbраized (e.g., plants and animals).

Wait, but the original text says ""which can be unicellular"" — so maybe it's not saying that all are or any are, just that they can. So perhaps:

Each living organism is built from cell (uniquely built?) which can be single or multiple.

But in the translation, maybe I should keep it simple: The basic unit is a cell which may be uniquely built or multiplicated.

Wait, but how to express ""may"" — maybe ""могут быть"". So:

Основная часть living organism — cell. Cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache..cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular). Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organismы, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биologичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

Wait, but in the original text, ""which can be unicellular"" — so perhaps it's saying that cells are either one or multiple. So maybe not.

Alternatively:

Каждый Living organism включается в основную часть living organism — cell._cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache..cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular). Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organismы, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биologичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

Hmm, but the user said ""make sure the translation fits in one continuous line."" So maybe I can combine all that into one sentence.

So perhaps:

Каждый Living organism включается в основную часть living organism — cell.cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache. cell может быть одноразностно-биologичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular).Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organismы, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биологичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

Wait, but in the original, it's ""which can be unicellular"" — so maybe the translation should say that each cell is either one or multiple. So perhaps:

Каждый Living organism включается в основную часть living organism — cell. cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache. cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular).Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organisms, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биologичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

But the user said ""make sure the translation fits in one continuous line."" So maybe I can combine it without spaces: ""Each living organism consists of basic cell units. Each cell is uniquely built or multiplicated.""

Wait, that seems better.

So:

Каждый Living organism включается в основную часть living organism — cell.cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache. cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular).Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organisms, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биologичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

Wait, but that's multiple sentences. Maybe I can combine it into one:

Каждый Living organism включается в основную часть living organism — cell.cell — unbekannt,agran polyyednache. cell может быть одноразностно-биологичным (uniquely built?) или многофimbраized (multicellular).Несмотря на то, что некоторые Organisms, такие какsome bacteria, могут быть одноразностно-биologичными (single cells), но они также многофimbraized (e.g., plants and animals).

Wait, but that's multiple sentences. Maybe I can make it one sentence.

Alternatively:

Each living organism consists of basic cell units which are either uniquely built or multiplicated in number.

Yes, maybe that works better.

DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.","<think>

Okay, I need to translate this text into Russian. Let me read it carefully: ""DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.""

First, I'll start with the main word ""DNA."" In Russian, it's ""днота"" or ""днота."" Wait, I think ""днота"" is used as a general term. But in technical contexts like genetics, sometimes ""деoxyribonucleic acid"" is used differently. Maybe ""деоприорибонуcléок ас tack"" would be more accurate to reflect its structure.

Next, the word ""molecule."" In Russian, that's usually ""мolecule,"" but I think ""мoleкule"" is correct here because we're talking about a molecule in this context. But sometimes people might use ""молекула."" Hmm, both are correct. I'll go with ""мOLEкуль.""

Then the phrase after ""is"": ""that carries the genetic instructions..."". In Russian, that would be ""что передает генетические инструкции..."" Maybe ""что передает генетические инструкции"" is simpler and less technical.

After that part: ""...in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms."" So I should write ""в росте, по发展中ении и функционировании всех living organismов."" Wait, in Russian ""living organism"" is written without an accent on 's,' right? Yes, it's just ""organism.""

The next part: ""...consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix."" For ""two strands,"" I think ""два струны."" For ""coil around,"" maybe ""вократно around."" And ""double helix"" is usually translated as ""дубловой хилл."" So the full sentence would be: ""что передает генетические инструкции... в росте, по发展中ении и функционировании всех living organismов. Вократно вдек sense around form double helix.""

Putting it all together: ""Днота (deоприорибонуcléок ас tack) — это молекуль, которая передает генетические инструкции... в росте, по发展中ении и функционировании всех living organismов. Вократно вдек sense around form double helix.""

Wait, let me check the spelling of ""deоприорибонуcléок ас tack."" I think it's correct as ""deoxyribonucleic acid."" In Russian, sometimes people use more descriptive words like ""деоприорибонуcléок ас tack"" instead of just ""днота.""

So the final translation would be:

""Dнота (deоприорибонуcléок ас tack) — это молекуль, которая передает генетические инструкции... в росте, по发展中ении и функционировании всех living organismов. Вократно вдек sense around form double helix.""

I think that covers all the parts accurately without using any line breaks or extra characters.
</think>

RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.","<think>
Okay, I need to translate the text ""RNA"" into Russian. Let's see... The word ""RNA"" stands for ribonucleic acid. In English, it's commonly referred to as RNA because of its structure and function in biological processes like mRNA and rRNAs.

I remember that in scientific contexts, especially in biology and biochemistry, the term RNA is often used as a general term. So when translating ""RNA,"" I should consider both its chemical name and common usage in Russian academic texts.

Looking up ""ribo"" in Russian, it refers to the ribosome or small subunit of mRNA. Then ""nucleic"" would be ""нуклический"" which is a general term for nucleic acids like RNA and DNA. So putting it together, it should be ""ribonuklic."" 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the correct conjugation or phrasing. Sometimes technical terms can have specific forms in Russian. Let me double-check that. Yes, I think ""ribonuklic"" is the correct translation for RNA.

So the final translation would just be ""ribonuklic,"" which fits perfectly as a single word without any additional characters or line breaks.
</think>

ribonuklic","<think>
Okay, so the user has given me this task where I need to translate a specific text into Russian. Let me read through it carefully.

The original text is: ""RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.""

Alright, first I should break this down. It starts with the term RNA translated as ""RNA."" The parenthetical says it's ribonucleic acid, so I might want to include that as well. Then it describes how RNA is similar to DNA but single-stranded.

Next part: RNA plays a key role in translating genetic information into proteins. So, the main idea here is the function of RNA in genetics.

Types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA are mentioned—those are standard classifications I should include.

I need to make sure that each translation is accurate. For instance, ""ribonucleic acid"" translates to ""ribonucletic acid,"" which is a common variant spelling. 

So, starting with ""Антидигитный酶омат (ribonucletic acid) — это молекуля, схожая на DNA, но из-за резервы аминов."" That seems correct.

Then, the next part should follow: ""Это играет ключевую роль в транскрипции генетической информации из-DNA в蛋白мы, с приватами type mRNA, tRNA и rRNA.""

I think that's accurate. I should make sure each term is correctly translated without any mistakes.

Now, putting it all together into one continuous line as the user requested. Let me write out each part in Russian and then combine them without any line breaks or extra characters.
</think>

Антидигитный酶омат (ribonucletic acid) — это молекуля, схожая на DNA, но из-за резервы аминов. Это играет ключевую роль в транскрипции генетической информации из-DNA в蛋白мы, с приватами type mRNA, tRNA и rRNA."
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.","<think>
Okay, let me figure out how to handle this user's request. They want me to translate ""Protein"" into Russian and output just the translation without any line breaks or extra characters. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't sound right because ""Protein"" is a scientific term related to biology. If they're asking for a literal translation, I might have to do something else.

Maybe they're trying to get help with a specific concept in Russian biology, like proteins being referred to as something else in another language. Perhaps they meant to ask about the structure or function of proteins, which are essential components in biological processes. I should consider that possibility and suggest translating ""Protein"" into ""Proteine,"" which is commonly used in biochemistry contexts.

Also, I need to make sure my response is just the translation without any additional text. So, I'll put only the word ""Proteine"" in a single continuous line for them.
</think>

Proteine","<think>
Okay, I need to translate this text into Russian. Let me read through it carefully. ""Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.""

First, I'll break down each part. ""Proteins"" translates to "" proteines."" They're a noun here.

Next, describing them as ""large, complex molecules made up of amino acids"" – I need to make sure the scientific terms are accurate in Russian. So ""large, complex molecules, consisting of amino acids.""

Then, the sentence structure is about their functions within organisms. I should keep it straightforward without adding extra words unless necessary.

The sentence ends with describing their roles: catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes. Each part needs proper translation and grammar in Russian.

I'll make sure each part flows naturally. Maybe start with ""Proteines"" as the main noun. Then explain their size and composition. After that, talk about their functions within organisms, mentioning enzymes for catalyzing reactions, structure for cells, and regulation of processes.

I need to ensure there are no line breaks or extra characters. The translation should be smooth in one continuous line.

Let me review each part again:

1. Proteines – correct noun form.
2. Large, complex molecules – ""мелкие и сложные молекулы.""
3. Consisting of amino acids – ""составлены аmino-acidами.""
4. Within organisms – ""в organismах.""
5. Catalyzing reactions (enzymes) – ""кayтиозных реакций с aidом.) 
6. Providing structure to cells – ""предоставляя структуру.""
7. Regulating biological processes – "" регулировать биологические процессes.""

Putting it all together, I think the translation is accurate and flows naturally in Russian.

One more time: ""Proteines — мелкие и сложные молекулы, состояенные из аmino-acидов. В organismахThey work providing structure to cells, catalyzing reactions (enzymes), and regulating biological processes.""

Yes, that makes sense and meets the requirements.
</think>

Proteines — мелкие и сложные молекулы, состояенные из а amino-acидов. В organismах
—they work providing structure to cells, catalizing reactions (enzymes), and regulating biological processes."
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate ""Enzyme"" into Russian and present it as a single line without any line breaks or extra characters. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should understand what an enzyme is. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They work under specific temperature and pH conditions, known as the ""staircase effect,"" where each stage requires a particular condition for optimal activity.

Now, translating this into Russian. Let me break down the word: ""Enzyme."" The root word is ""enzyme."" In Russian, the noun form can be either ""酶"" (ze'nyo), which means enzyme. It's commonly used in scientific contexts.

Next, I should consider if there are any specific terms or nuances when translating this word into Russian. For example, sometimes hyphens are added to avoid ambiguity, but since ""enzyme"" is a standard term and doesn't have multiple parts that could be misinterpreted, it might not require them here.

I also need to ensure the translation is grammatically correct in Russian. The direct translation would be ""酶,"" which is perfectly appropriate. It fits well within a scientific text context where precise terminology is essential.

Are there any other considerations? Well, since this is a single word, I don't think multiple sentences are involved here. So, just providing the translated word as a continuous line should suffice without needing additional punctuation or formatting.

I can double-check using a reliable Russian dictionary to confirm that ""酶"" is the correct translation and fits seamlessly in a scientific context. Yes, it does. It's commonly used when discussing enzymes, their functions, and the conditions they operate under.

Therefore, the final translation of ""Enzyme"" into Russian would be straightforward: ""酶.""
</think>

Enzyme","<think>
Alright, I need to translate this text into Russian. Let's read through it carefully. The original text says: ""Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.""

First, I'll break down each sentence. ""Enzymes"" is straightforward—it translates to ""enzyme."" The next part says they're biological catalysts. So, ""biological catalysts""—I think that's best translated as ""bioхидорные催化剂ы,"" which means enzymes are bio-hydridic catalysts.

Then it mentions they speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. In Russian, ""living organisms"" is often referred to as ""об jotных organismах,"" so I'll write that out.

Next, the sentence about them being proteins: ""typically proteins."" The word ""typically"" can be translated as ""сред instance,"" and ""proteines""—I need to make sure this part reads well. So it becomes ""сред instance proteines.""

The last part explains how they work by lowering activation energy. That translates to ""что делают на speed up reactions in living organisms."" For the mechanism, I'll say ""что делают на speed up reactions в биотехнических organismах,"" which conveys their role effectively.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the translation flows naturally and is grammatically correct. Let me check each word for accuracy:

- enzymes → enzyme
- biological catalysts → bioхидорные催化剂ы
- speed up chemical reactions → что делают на speed up reactions
- living organisms → биотехнических organismах

Everything seems to fit well. Now, I'll put it all into one continuous line without any line breaks or extra characters.

Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.","<think>
Alright, so I need to translate ""Lipid"" into Russian. Let me think about how words are usually translated in this context. ""Lipid"" sounds like a chemical substance, and it's commonly used in various scientific fields. 

First, the base word is ""lipid."" In Russian, ""lipid"" translates directly as ""liquid."" However, I recall that sometimes people might use ""liquidus"" for the same meaning. But I think the more straightforward translation is just ""liquid.""

Next, considering the context—chemistry-related terms often have specific Russian equivalents. For instance, if it were a compound, we might add numbers or specific terms, but since it's singular here, ""liquid"" should suffice.

Let me double-check: in scientific contexts, especially in chemistry, ""lipid"" is indeed translated as ""liquid."" It can refer to things like triglycerides, which are compounds of lipids. So using ""liquidus"" might be overcomplicating it unnecessarily since it's just a single word without any additional numbers or words.

Therefore, the translation should simply be ""liquid.""
</think>

liquid","<think>
Okay, so I've been given this task to translate a piece of text into Russian. The user wants the translation in one continuous line without any line breaks or extra characters. Let me read through the original text carefully.

The text is about lipids being a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. It also explains their roles as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, signaling molecules, and their importance for maintaining cell integrity and function.

First, I need to make sure I understand the main points of the text. Lipids are categorized into hydrophobic or amphipathic; examples include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They store energy, are structural parts in cell membranes, act as signaling molecules, maintaining cell structure and function.

Now, translating this into Russian. I should preserve the technical terms accurately. Let me break down each part:

1. ""Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules..."" – So, I'll translate it to something like ""Липиды — это гибкий набор гидролитических или амптидичных molecule."" That keeps the structure correct.

2. ""That include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols"" – These are the specific examples. So, I can write them as ""включая лимоны, океаны, гибридные польлиды и гидротерапии.""

3. Then, the role in cell membranes, signaling, etc. The original says: serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.

In Russian, "" Serve as energy storage..."" could be ""С serve в роли энергетического储备"". Similarly, for membrane structure, it's ""С扮演 существующий физический структуру"". For signaling, ""С perform the role of communicate"".

Putting it all together: Lipids — это гибкий набор гидролитических или амптидичных molecule. Включая лимоны, океаны, гибридные польлиды и гидротерапии. С serve в роль энергетического储备, существующий физический структуру, perform the role of communicate.

Wait, let me check if "" Serve as energy storage..."" is correct in Russian. I think it's ""С serve в роли энергетического储备"" — yes, that's right. Similarly, the next part should be ""С扮演 существующий физический структуру."" Yes, and then ""perform the role of communicate."" That seems accurate.

Let me also check if all terms are correctly translated. Lipid — lipid, as usual. Hydrophobic or amphipathic — гибкий набор гидролитических или амптидичных molecule. The examples included fats, oils, phospholipids, sterols: includes... yes. So everything looks good.

I think that's it. Let me put it all together as one continuous line without any additional characters or line breaks.
</think>

Липиды — это гибкий набор гидролитических или амптидичных molecule. Включая лимоны, океаны, гибридные польлиды и гидротерапии. С serve в роль энергетического储备, существующий физический структуру, perform the role of communicate."
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.","<think>
Alright, let me tackle this user's request step by step. The user wants me to translate ""Glycan"" into Russian. First, I need to make sure I understand what Glycan means. It refers to a carbohydrate molecule composed of multiple monosaccharides linked together. So, the term is commonly used in biology and medicine.

Next, I'll think about how to translate it accurately. In Russian, ""glycane"" directly translates from the Greek ""glycone,"" which means a carbohydrate or similar molecule. That makes sense because Glycan and glycane are synonyms in this context. It's important to ensure that the translation is both correct and widely recognized.

I should also consider if there are other terms used in Russian for this concept, but since the user asked for ""Glycan,"" it's safe to go with ""glycane."" I'll double-check the spelling to avoid any confusion: glycane vs. glycone. It turns out they are pronounced differently, so both spellings are correct in their respective dialects.

Now, putting it all together, I can confidently say that Glycan translates to ""glycane"" in Russian without any issues. The user's request is straightforward—just a translation, no additional formatting. So, I'll provide the translation as-is, ensuring there are no extra characters or line breaks.
</think>

Glycan","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate this entire query from English to Russian. The user has given me the text they want translated, which includes specific instructions about ensuring it's only one continuous line without any line breaks or extra characters.

First, I'll read through the text carefully. It defines glycan as a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules attached to proteins or lipids via glycosylation. Then, it explains that glycans are involved in various biological processes like cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.

I need to make sure each term is accurately translated. Let's go through each word:

- ""A glycan"" → ""glypan""
- ""is a carbohydrate or saccharide"" → ""собрается с гатурией или грачной molecule""
- ""typically a polymer of sugar molecules"" → ""на Typically, это сложение из грусявных молекул""
- ""that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation"" → ""а能够在 фоамилациях и лиопаритиях с формацией гydroглиокислия""
- ""that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation."" → ""что может быть при фоамилациях и лиопаритии с формацией гydroглиокислия.""
- ""Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including"" → ""Согласно упомяшим приведentам""
- ""cell-cell communication,"" ""immune response,"" ""protein folding"" → ""в различных биологических процессах, включая""

Putting it all together, I need to ensure the translation flows naturally and maintains the original meaning. I'll check for any awkward phrasing or missing hyphens. Since the user specified no line breaks or extra characters, I'll make sure the entire translated text is a single continuous sentence without any formatting issues.

Finally, I'll review the translation to ensure it reads smoothly in Russian and accurately reflects all the key points from the original English text.
</think>

Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate ""Chromosome"" into Russian. Hmm, let me think about this. The word ""chromosome"" sounds like it's related to biology, maybe a genetic structure. In English, I know that it often refers to the DNA segment located between two genes or regulatory regions.

Now, translating this should focus on maintaining the scientific meaning. In Russian, words are usually kept in their native forms unless there's an exact match. So ""chromosome"" doesn't have a direct translation as I know it does in English or other languages. 

I don't remember any specific Russian term for this concept off the top of my head, so it might be safer to just use the same word if possible. Let me check if ""chromosome"" is used differently in Russian scientific terminology. If not, then using it as is should be appropriate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Sometimes technical terms are kept the same across languages unless there's a specific term for them. So yes, sticking with ""Chromosome"" seems right here.
</think>

Chromosome","<think>
Alright, let's tackle this translation task step by step. The user has provided a text in English and wants it translated into Russian. I need to make sure that the translation is accurate and maintains the original meaning.

First, I'll read through the entire English text carefully: ""A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.""

I notice the sentence starts with ""A chromosome..."". In Russian, ""chromosome"" translates to ""кromонышь"" (kroomyshь). The rest follows grammatically correctly. I should ensure that terms like ""long, thread-like structure"" are accurately translated.

Next, ""made of DNA and proteins"" is straightforward. ""DNA"" is ""даная"" (danna) in Russian, and ""proteins"" is "" proteины"" ( proteiны). So it becomes ""составлен из даны и аминокиселенов.""

The phrase about carrying genetic information is a bit more complex. In English, it's ""carries the genetic information of an organism."" In Russian, I can keep this as ""как отвечает геймик информатыоном Organismа,"" which clearly conveys that part.

Finally, ""humans have 23 pairs"" is translated to ""humanы в 23 парах кromонышь."" It's important to note that the word order in Russian for possessive numbers can sometimes be tricky, but here it seems correct.

Putting it all together: ""Комронышь — это леон ideally тонкий структура из даная и аминокиселенов. Она отвечает геймик информатыоном Organismsa, и человы в 23 парах кromонышь.""

I should double-check each term to ensure accuracy and that the sentence flows naturally in Russian. Also, making sure there are no line breaks or extra characters is crucial as per the user's instructions.

Looking at any potential errors: ""леон ideally тонкий"" — is it correct? ""Лемон ideally тонкий"" seems more natural. So I'll adjust that part for clarity and correctness in Russian.

Finalizing, the translated text should look like this:

Комронышь — это лемон ideally тонкий структура из даная и аминокиселенов. Она отвечает геймик информатыоном Organismsa, и человы в 23 парах кromонышь.

Yes, this seems accurate and meets all the user's requirements.

Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.","<think>
Okay, I need to translate ""Mitochondria"" into Russian. Let me think about what each part means. mitochondria is a cell organelle responsible for producing ATP. In Russian, mitochondria are called ""яллоны"" or sometimes referred to as ""митозоны."" 

First, the word ""Mitochondria"" starts with ""Mito,"" which in Russian is often translated as ""Ялloны."" I should check if there's a more common term. Maybe ""Яллоны"" is sufficient for clarity.

Next, the plural form of mitochondria would be ""яллоны."" So combining them, it's ""Яллоны.""

I want to make sure there are no extra characters or line breaks. Since this is just a simple translation, I can put everything on one line without any additional formatting.

Яллоны","<think>
Okay, so I need to translate this text about mitochondria into Russian. The user provided an example translation which is helpful. Let me read through it carefully.

The original text talks about mitochondria being organelles in eukaryotic cells that produce ATP. It mentions they are called the 'powerhouses' of the cell and play a role in regulating cell cycle and growth. 

First, I need to break down each part. ""Mitochondria are organelles found..."" – mitochondria are the organelles; eukaryotic cells, so that's correct. ""that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP."" So, energy is ATP.

Next, ""often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell"" – the term 'powerhouse' fits because mitochondria are like a powerhouse. Then they explain how they regulate the cell cycle and growth. 

In translation, I should maintain this structure. Let me start with ""Мион抑ело are Organиполы в кирилличных клетках..."" – that's mitochondria in eukaryotic cells correctly translated.

Next: ""that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP."" So, 'вformе ATPA' as it should be. The word 'ATPA' might sound unusual, but it's correct. 

Then, ""often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell"" – 'моиiningячие' fits well here.

Finally, ""play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth."" So, 'об监督е cell cycle и уреждение cell growth.' Putting it all together:

Мион抑ело are Organиполы в кирилличных клетках, что они organиполы, которые в forma ATP генерируют фосфорный база мион-организма. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating cell cycle and cell growth.

I think this captures all the key points correctly. Let me double-check each part for accuracy. ""Organиполы"" is correct for cells. ""ATPA"" is the right word here. ""Моиiningячие"" does fit 'powerhouses'. ""Кирилличные клетки"" makes sure it's eukaryotic cells.

Alright, that should be a precise translation.
