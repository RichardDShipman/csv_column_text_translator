Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,基因是由DNA序列组成的，这些序列包含制造特定蛋白质或RNA分子的指令。基因是遗传的基本单位，并负责决定生物体的特性。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是构成和执行生命的基本结构和功能单位。所有生物体均由细胞组成，这些细胞可以是单细胞（如单细胞生物）或多细胞（例如植物和动物）。
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",脱氧核糖核酸,脱氧核糖核酸（脱氧核糖核酸）是一种携带生物体生长、发育和正常功能遗传指令的分子。它由两个螺旋互相缠绕的链组成，形成双螺旋结构。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",核糖核酸,核糖核酸（ribonucleic酸）是一种与DNA相似的分子，但通常为单链。核糖核酸在将从DNA传递来的遗传信息翻译成蛋白质中起着关键作用，类型包括mRNA、tRNA和rRNA。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,蛋白质是由氨基酸组成的复杂大分子。它们在生物体内执行各种各样的功能，包括催化反应（酶）、为细胞提供结构以及调节生物过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物催化剂，它们加快了活体内化学反应的速度。通常它们是由蛋白质构成的，降低反应的活化能，使它能够更快、更有效地进行。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂质,脂类是种类多样的疏水或两亲性分子，包括脂肪、油、磷脂和胆固醇。它们作为能量储存、细胞膜的结构成分以及信号分子起作用，并且对于维持细胞完整性与功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖蛋白,糖胺聚糖是一种碳水化合物或单糖聚合物，通常是糖分子的聚合体，在糖基化过程中连接到蛋白质或脂质上。糖胺在细胞间通讯、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠等方面涉及多种生物学过程。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,染色体是一条长而丝状的结构，由DNA和蛋白质组成。它们携带着生物体的遗传信息，并且人类在细胞中拥有23对染色体。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",线粒体,线粒体是存在于真核细胞中的细胞器，负责以ATP的形式产生能量。通常被称为细胞的“动力工厂”，线粒体还参与调控细胞周期和细胞生长。
