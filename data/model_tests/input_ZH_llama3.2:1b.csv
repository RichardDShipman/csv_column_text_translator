Gene,A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for determining the traits of an organism.,基因,一条基因是DNA序列中含有编码特定蛋白质或核酸分子所需的指令。基因是遗传物质的基本单位，负责决定个体的遗传特征。
Cell,"The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells, which can be unicellular (single-celled organisms) or multicellular (such as plants and animals).",细胞,细胞是生命的基本结构和功能单元所有活跃生物都是由细胞组成可以是单细胞（单细胞生物）或者多细胞（如植物和动物）
DNA,"DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, and functioning of all living organisms. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix.",核苷酸,DNA是遗传信息的载体，位于细胞核中组成具有遗传功能的所有生物。它由两条单链成分紧密连接到一起形成双螺旋结构。
RNA,"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule similar to DNA but typically single-stranded. RNA plays a key role in translating the genetic information from DNA into proteins, with types such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",核苷酸,RNA是一种类似的核酸基质，但通常单链。RNA在DNA信息从基因解释为蛋白质的过程中扮演着关键角色，具有mRNA、tRNA和rRNA等类型。
Protein,"Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing reactions (enzymes), providing structure to cells, and regulating biological processes.",蛋白质,ProteINS  are  large  complex  molecules  made  up  of  amino  acids他们的工作场所是生物体中各种过程，包括促进反应（酶）、提供细胞结构以及调节生物学过程。
Enzyme,"Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to proceed more quickly and efficiently.",酶,酶是生物体中催化化学反应的生物活性剂，通常为蛋白质，它们通过降低反应活力来促进反应进行更快速和更 hiệu率的发展。
Lipid,"Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules that include fats, oils, phospholipids, and sterols. They serve as energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and signaling molecules, and are essential for maintaining cell integrity and function.",脂质,脂质是由水不溶性或双磷酸脂的分子组成的一类，其包括脂肪、油和磷脂等。它们为细胞膜结构物质储存能量，参与胞膜的信号传导，并且对于保持细胞功能至关重要。
Glycan,"A glycan is a carbohydrate or saccharide, typically a polymer of sugar molecules, that can be attached to proteins or lipids in the form of glycosylation. Glycans are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein folding.",糖苷,Aglycan是一种碳水化合物或糖醇，通常是由糖分子组成的(polymer)，可以与蛋白质或脂肪结合形成糖化。糖化参与多种生物学过程，包括细胞间信号传导、免疫反应和蛋白质折叠。
Chromosome,"A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins. It carries the genetic information of an organism, and humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells.",染色体,一条染色体是DNA和蛋白质的长，纤维样结构，具有遗传信息，人类有23对染色体存在于细胞中。
Mitochondria,"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Often called the 'powerhouses' of the cell, mitochondria also play a role in regulating the cell cycle and cell growth.",细胞核中的小叶,Mitochondrial是细胞的核外结构，负责产生能量以形成三磷酸腺苷（ATP）。它们被称为细胞“能源母宫”（powerhouses），还参与调节细胞周期和生长。
